    //     seam has its OWN override (LayoutTextOutline.TestOverrideTypeface, serialized by
    //     tests/Ui.Tests' LayoutTextOutlineTypefaceCollection), which is the one label tests mean.
    //   * A test asserting that the embedded faces resolve at all. The public properties cannot
    //     serve that: the override is a shared mutable static, roughly ten test classes set it to
    //     SKTypeface.Default for the duration of their own tests, and xunit runs classes in
    //     PARALLEL — so reading DejaVuRegular reports the suite's scheduling, not the loader.
