// ================================================================
//  IPlotDataSources.cs  —  the one thing a `.cdd` needs that is not in
//  the `.cdd`: its data
//
//  RND-4 (R-rnd4-2). A Data Display document names its sources; it does
//  not contain them. In the application that lookup is
//  `DataSourceLibraryViewModel` — an observable collection of entries
//  with aliases, lazy loading, broken-entry placeholders, a toolbar
//  selection and a change event. None of that belongs below the
//  firewall, and none of it is what the RESOLUTION needs: the resolution
//  needs a path for a reference, and a DataSet or an SNP for a path.
//
//  So this is the seam. src/Ui implements it over the library;
//  `circuitrf render` implements it over the files the caller named with
//  `--data` and the ones the document resolves beside itself. Both
//  resolve traces through the same code, which is the whole point.
