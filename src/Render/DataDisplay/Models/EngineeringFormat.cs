// ================================================================
//  EngineeringFormat.cs — SI-prefixed numbers for axes, tables and markers.
//
//  Why this exists. Every number format in the Data Display was written for quantities of order
//  one: S-parameter magnitudes, decibels, degrees, stability factors, ohms. The passive readouts
//  are not — an effective capacitance is 1e-12 to 1e-3 farads and an effective inductance 1e-12 to
//  1e-6 henries — and three separate pieces of the display failed on them, each silently:
//
//    * the table's default "F3" renders 100 pF as "0.000";
//    * an axis tick's "G3" renders 1e-7 as "1E-07", and every tick of a narrow window renders
//      IDENTICALLY, so the axis carries no information at all;
//    * worst, the axis label's near-zero snap was the ABSOLUTE constant 1e-12, so every tick of a
//      picofarad axis was snapped to exactly zero. The axis was not merely ugly, it was destroyed.
//
//  One formatter fixes all three, and the reason it can be turned on without auditing every
//  existing plot is that IT IS A NO-OP IN THE RANGE WHERE THE CURRENT OUTPUT IS ALREADY GOOD. See
//  ShouldPrefix: between a milli and a hundred thousand, this returns exactly what the plain format
//  string returns, character for character. A magnitude axis running 0…1 keeps "0.5"; it does not
//  become "500m".
