// ================================================================
//  DataSourceView.cs  —  the two things a loaded source GAINS before a
//  trace can be resolved against it
//
//  RND-4 (R-rnd4-2). Both were `DataSourceEntryViewModel`'s, and neither
//  is view-model work: each is a pure function of a DataSet, in RfCore
//  terms. They came down because `circuitrf render` was silently WORSE
//  without them, in two ways that both looked like an empty plot:
//
//   • A trace on "SP1.Z" resolved to nothing, because Z is a VIRTUAL
//     cube — a simulated S-parameter run carries S and Z0 and no Z at
//     all, and the conversion happens on first read.
//   • Every DERIVED trace (Max Gain, µ, a stability circle) was dropped
//     as the display opened, because a simulated run has no SNP by
//     design and the network view that stands in for one was built in
//     the view model.
//
//  Both were found by §5.2's per-kind gate, which is exactly what that
//  gate is for: each is a picture that draws, exports cleanly, and is
//  missing a curve.
