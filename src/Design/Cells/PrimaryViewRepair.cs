// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  PrimaryViewRepair — what happens to a cell's PRIMARY when one of its view files
//  is removed.
//
//  Removing a .csch / .csym / .clay used to be a file delete and nothing else, so a
//  cell whose primary was the file that went away was left in
//  PrimaryState.MissingNamedPrimary — the state CellFolder's own doc comment calls
//  "a blatant contradiction" and the Project Tree renders as a warning. The user who
//  deleted one of two schematics got a warning triangle on a cell they had just
//  tidied, and no indication of what to do about it.
//
//  The .ccell is repaired in the SAME operation as the removal, because the two are
//  one act: the file is gone, so the record that names it is wrong the instant it is.
//  Which repair is right depends only on what survives (see Apply).
//
//  In src/Design rather than in the view model because it is .ccell arithmetic over a
//  cell folder — no dialog, no canvas, no workspace — and because the same repair is
//  owed to any future non-GUI caller that removes a view.
