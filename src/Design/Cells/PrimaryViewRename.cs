// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  PrimaryViewRename — give a cell's PRIMARY view files the cell's own name.
//
//  Two operations owe this and both used to do it themselves: Rename Cell (when the
//  user asks for the primaries to follow) and Duplicate Cell (always — a copy named
//  "amp_v2" holding "amp.csch" is a copy whose folder and files disagree from the
//  moment it exists).
//
//  They were two copies of the same twenty lines, which is exactly how the layout
//  came to be renamed by one and not the other: ViewType.Layout was added to Rename's
//  list and there was no reason for anyone to think of Duplicate's. One list, here,
//  and both callers get every view type a cell can have.
//
//  In src/Design rather than in the view model for PrimaryViewRepair's reason: it is
//  file names and .ccell arithmetic over a cell folder — no dialog, no canvas, no
//  workspace — and a headless caller that copies a cell owes exactly the same tidy-up.
//
//  What it deliberately does NOT do is touch anything a view file POINTS at. A .clay
//  is paired with its .wBond by shared stem (WBondCell.Resolve), so renaming one owes
//  the other; that pairing lives above this layer and the Layout result carries the
//  old stem so the caller can honour it.
