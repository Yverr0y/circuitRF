// Which field on a stackup row an EM run cannot use, and why — one answer per FIELD.
//
// WHY A SECOND SHAPE OF THE SAME QUESTION. TechValidation already reports every one of these, and its
// output is a list of SENTENCES attributed to a TAB. That is the right shape for the problems panel and
// the wrong shape for the editor's own text boxes: a sentence naming a layer by name cannot tell a
// TextBox whether it is the one at fault, and a rule re-implemented beside the box would drift from the
// one the extractors actually refuse on — silently, and in the direction that matters (a field marked
// fine that stops a run).
//
// So the PREDICATES live here, once, and both readers use them: TechValidation phrases them as
// sentences, and the Technology editor marks the field. The thresholds are the extractors' own —
// Epsr >= 1, positive thickness, positive conductivity — not a second opinion about what is plausible.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a judgement about whether a value is RIGHT. 4.4 on a board that is
// actually 3.66 passes every check here, because nothing in circuitRF knows which board it is looking
// at; that is what the import's own "these are guesses" message is for (SubstrateDefaults). This
// answers only "would an EM run refuse this outright", which is the question a highlight can honestly
// answer.
