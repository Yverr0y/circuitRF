// MIM-7 — a dielectric that is PATTERNED with a conductor, and what an extractor does with one.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE, when PlanarExtractor's header is emphatic that the two extractors
// restate the stackup rules rather than call into each other. That stance is about the hard part of
// the cross-section extractor — the reduction test and its refusals, which must never appear on the
// planar acceptance path. This rule is the opposite shape: it is one paragraph of policy plus one
// sentence of USER-FACING TEXT, and the sentence is the reason it is shared. A run whose medium
// silently lost a layer is the failure the note exists to prevent, and two copies of the note would
// drift into two different accounts of the same decision.
//
// The two callers ask the same question with different words for "in this run":
//   * PlanarExtractor  — is the plate conductor one of the ANALYSIS LEVELS? (a set)
//   * CrossSectionExtractor — is the plate conductor THE signal conductor? (exactly one, since a
//     uniform-line cross-section refuses multi-level geometry outright)
// and only the planar one has a sheet surface to revert, because only it solves a conductor as a
// zero-thickness sheet — the cross-section kernel models real metal of real thickness and does not
// read SheetAt at all (MIM-6's own recorded decision).
//
// ── MIM-11 — THE TIE MAY NAME A MASK, AND THAT IS THE NAME THAT IS TRUE ──────────────────────────
//
// MIM-7 tied the film to its PLATE conductor because the plate is what a run's level list talks
// about, and on this process that is a proxy: what actually defines where a thin film exists is the
// nitride mask the fab streams out, and the plate is deposited on top of what that mask left. The
// proxy was load-bearing in one direction only — a layout with no plate on it has no film — and it
// broke down the moment the mask itself became drawable (MIM-11 item 1): a nitride-only structure
// could not be expressed at all, because the film's presence was a statement about a different
// layer.
//
// So `PresentWithLayer` now resolves in TWO namespaces, and the precedence is the load-bearing part:
// a CONDUCTOR stackup entry first, exactly as before, so every technology authored against MIM-7
// resolves the same name to the same rule and extracts bit for bit as it did; a DRAWING LAYER
// second, in which case "in this run" means "this run's layout carries artwork on that layer".
//
// WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE. It is still a per-run ON/OFF and never a lateral pattern. Inside a run every
// dielectric is laterally infinite — that is the 2.5D formulation and not a limitation of this file
// — so a drawn nitride polygon does not make the film finite, it only decides whether the film is in
// the medium at all. MIM-11's own measurement of what that costs is in src/Design/RESOLVED.md, and
// PlanarExtractor says it in the run's own notes with the coverage fraction attached.
