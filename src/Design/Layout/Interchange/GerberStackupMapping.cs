// A job file's MaterialStackup -> circuitRF's Stackup (docs/sonnet-briefs/
// brief-L4g-gerber-import-orchestration.md §3, R-L4g-9).
//
// THE POINT OF THIS FILE IS WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. A .gbrjob carries an ordered, top-to-bottom list of
// copper, dielectric, mask, paste and legend entries, each with a THICKNESS and a material name, plus
// the board's overall thickness and layer count. That is a real fraction of a .ctech and it is taken.
// What the format still does not carry is the ELECTRICAL part — relative permittivity, loss tangent,
// conductivity, permeability, and the top/bottom boundary conditions — and the two optional fields it
// does define for the first two are routinely absent from a real export.
//
// So the gaps are named, once, in one paragraph, and nothing is inferred FROM THE FILES:
//  * permittivity and loss tangent are read if present;
//  * conductivity and Mur are defaulted exactly as PcbStackupMapping already defaults them, through
//    the same constant, and are NAMED as defaults in the same note;
//  * with no job file at all the STRUCTURE is built from the artwork alone (GI2);
//  * and every substrate value still missing after all of that is completed from ONE generic FR-4
//    board and reported (owner, 2026-09-08 — see SubstrateDefaults).
//
// GI2 (brief-gi2-stackup-skeleton.md) separates two things this file used to refuse together. How many
// conductors there are, in what order, called what, bound to which drawing layer, is bookkeeping the
// IMPORT HAS ALREADY DONE — it is in the files and the cascade resolved it. Thickness, permittivity and
// loss tangent are not in the files at all.
//
// WHAT CHANGED ON 2026-09-08, AND WHAT DID NOT. GI2 spelled the second half ZERO — zero thickness and
// Epsr = 0, outside every extractor's guard and outside TechValidation's `Epsr < 1`, so a skeleton was
// UNSIMULATABLE by construction. That was aimed squarely at Epsr's own C# default of 1.0, which is AIR:
// a perfectly valid substrate that runs and answers the wrong question. The owner's decision is that
// the zeros were being paid for on every Gerber import — eleven rows of numbers typed by hand on a
// six-layer board — and that a NAMED, REPORTED default is not the silent-air failure GI2 guarded
// against. So the values are supplied and the message says which ones and that they are guesses.
// The guard against a value nobody checked now lives in two places instead of the zeros: this file's
// own message, and the Technology editor marking any field an EM run cannot use. What has NOT changed
// is the refusal to read a substrate out of the FILES: no material-name lookup, ever — see below.
//
// Never infer permittivity from a material name. It is a lookup table of laminate trade names, it is
// out of scope, and it would put third-party product names into this repo (root CLAUDE.md
// §"Commercial Vendor References"). PcbStackupMapping refuses this by name already; this refuses it
// for the same reason, and neither may ever grow the table.
