// The single Clipper2 conversion point (docs/design/layout-view.md §6.1): booleans, offsets, DRC

// tolerance is never chosen twice with two different answers. Built on LayoutFlattener — this file
// must NOT re-implement curve flattening.
//
// Our DBU integers go straight in: Clipper2's Path64/Point64 are long-based, exactly §1.1's storage
// type. No scaling to a working integer grid, no float conversion, no precision loss anywhere in this
// pipeline — the tempting "scale to a working integer grid" step other clipping libraries need is
// simply absent here. Coordinate magnitudes (<= ~10^9) sit far inside Clipper2's safe range.
//
// Fill rule: FillRule.NonZero everywhere, stated once here and never varied per call site — it is
// what makes self-intersection repair (LayoutBooleans.Repair) produce the outer region rather than a
// checkerboard.
