/// owner edits them there (2026-09-15). An embedded resource would have to be unpacked before it
/// could be opened at all, which means the copy the application ships and the copy anyone edits are
/// two different artifacts with nothing keeping them in step. The shipped tree is the SAME tree —
/// <c>src/Ui/CircuitRF.Ui.csproj</c> copies <c>examples/**</c> into the app output the same way it
/// copies the user documentation and the PCell Python package.</para>
///
/// <h3>The index is data beside them, not a list in here</h3>
/// <para><c>examples/examples.json</c> gives the order, the menu titles and the one-line summaries.
/// Discovery-by-directory-scan was the alternative and it cannot express either of the first two;
/// a list compiled into circuitRF cannot be edited alongside the thing it describes. A folder named
/// in the index that is not on disk is SKIPPED rather than shown as a menu item that fails when
/// pressed — the two can disagree on a partial install, and the menu is the wrong place to find
/// out.</para>
