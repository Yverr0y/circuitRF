/// <para><b>Why it exists (2026-09-15).</b> <see cref="NetExtractor.Extract"/> takes the resolver as
/// an optional argument and treats a null one as "flat caller — skip silently", which is the right
/// answer for a caller extracting a single schematic that cannot contain a cell instance and the
/// wrong one for everything else. Both CLI extraction sites passed null. The result was not a
/// failure: a design whose device lives in a sub-cell netlisted, checked clean and RAN, as the
/// passive network left behind once the device was dropped. A power amplifier came back at
/// −72 dB gain with <c>Converged = 1</c> on every point, and nothing anywhere said a component had
/// been left out. <c>circuitrf check</c> reported zero errors on the same design, because it
/// extracted the same way.</para>
///
/// <para><b>It is the GUI's own descent, not a second one.</b> <c>WorkspaceViewModel.Resolve</c> is
/// this function plus one thing this cannot have: memory-else-disk, so an unsaved edit in an open
/// tab is what the run sees. Everything else — <see cref="HierarchyResolver.ResolvePrimaryPath"/>,
/// the cell folder two levels up from the primary, the <c>.ccell</c> parameter interface, and the
/// absolute folder as the cell KEY — is shared, and the two are compared directly by
/// <c>tests/Ui.Tests/Cli/CliHierarchyExtractionTests.cs</c>. A headless resolver that resolved
/// differently from the window's would be a second product, which is the failure

/// <para><b>Stateless and cheap.</b> A cell instantiated twenty times is read twenty times; the
