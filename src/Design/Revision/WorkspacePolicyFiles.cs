/// enough: <b>every workspace that exists today was created before that function wrote one</b>, so
/// under creation-only they would never receive a <c>.gitignore</c> at all and would track results
/// forever. They are precisely the workspaces that matter — the ones with years of accumulated output
/// already in them. Three paths reach here: New Workspace, the first arming of an existing workspace,
/// and RC-6's ADOPTION of a user's repository (adoption because that is circuitRF taking
/// responsibility for what is kept, and it is the moment the user said yes).</para>

/// designer may edit it and RC-5's large-file guard appends to it. <b>circuitRF adds lines and never
/// rewrites the file</b>, and never removes a line it did not add in that same operation. A policy
