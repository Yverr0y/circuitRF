/// <para><b>It reads what the other verbs read.</b> A workspace is a directory holding a
/// <c>.cws</c> (<see cref="DocumentKinds.Classify"/>), its cells are <see cref="CellLookup"/>'s
/// answer, each view is <c>CellFolder.ResolvePrimary</c>'s, and the analyses are the ones the
/// elaborator would see — <see cref="CircuitSource"/>'s extraction, which is the GUI's own Simulate
/// path. A second enumerator here could disagree with what <c>render</c> draws and what <c>run</c>
/// dispatches, and the disagreement would look like a missing cell.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The walk is BOUNDED and says when it stopped short.</b> A listing that quietly gave up
/// is the one failure this verb must not have: a caller reads a short answer as "the workspace I am
/// looking for is not here" and goes elsewhere. So <c>--depth</c> is an argument, the default is

///
/// <para><b>It never leaves the root.</b> A directory symbolic link is not followed, and every path
