///
/// <para><b>Why this record exists.</b> The rule itself has not changed and neither has a single one
/// of its sentences: a <c>parametric_sweep</c> wrapping the analysis is dispatched AT THE SWEEP, and
/// naming the inner analysis is promoted rather than honoured, because the alternative is a
/// converged, plausible, complete-looking result for a run the caller thinks swept. What changed is
/// that <c>explain --analysis</c> has to REPORT that decision without making it — and a function
/// whose only account of itself is two <c>Console.Error.WriteLine</c> calls cannot be reported on.
/// So the decision comes back here and the CALLER writes the sentence: the run verbs write exactly
/// the two they always wrote (R-aut0-3 — a script watching stderr must not notice this landing), and
/// <c>explain</c> writes nothing and renders the same facts into its report.</para>
///
/// <para><b>This is the extraction R-aut4-2 asks for, not a second copy.</b> Gate 4 of
/// <c>brief-automation-4-check-and-explain.md</c> asserts <c>explain --analysis</c> against what
/// <c>hb</c>/<c>lp</c> actually dispatch rather than against a transcription of this logic — which is
/// only a meaningful gate while there is one implementation for both to reach.</para>
