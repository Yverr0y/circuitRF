/// <see cref="CancellationToken.None"/>, and the engines take the same optional argument they
/// already took. The only caller that sets any of it is <c>serve</c>
/// (brief-automation-5-protocol-adapter.md R-aut5-8): a de-embedded full-wave point costs over a
/// minute, and a client with no progress and no cancel simply times out and retries, doubling the
/// cost of the very run it gave up on.</para>

/// <para><b>It is the same <see cref="RunControl"/> the <c>em</c> verb already uses</b>, not a second
/// mechanism — cancellation lands at a work boundary and progress counts leaf units, exactly as that
/// type's own contract describes. What this class adds is only WHERE the token and the observer come
/// from.</para>

/// <para><b>Cancellation is not wired to a lone HB solve</b>, because there is nothing to wire it to:
/// <c>HbEngine.Run</c> takes no control, and <see cref="RunControl"/>'s own remarks say a single
/// Newton loop runs to completion by design. A swept HB cancels at its point boundary like everything
