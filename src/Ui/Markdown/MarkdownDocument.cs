/// <see cref="Lines"/>, and the parsed lines are all this document holds — the source text is not
/// kept, so there is nothing an edit could be applied to and nothing a save could write. It is
/// therefore absent from <c>HasSaveRoute</c>/<c>HasSaveAsRoute</c> for the reason the Welcome stub
/// is: a menu item that does not apply is not a menu item that is temporarily unavailable. It is
/// never dirty, so it never joins a close prompt or a Save All.</para>
///
/// <para>circuitRF is not a Markdown editor and this is not the first step towards one. The file is
/// an ordinary file in the user's own workspace folder and their own editor is the right place to
/// change it; what circuitRF owes them is that opening the workspace SHOWS it.</para>
