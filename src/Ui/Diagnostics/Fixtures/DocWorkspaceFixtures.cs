/// The WORKSPACE figure: circuitRF's whole window — menu bar, toolbar, the docked tool panels and a

/// real <see cref="WorkspaceViewModel"/>.
///
/// <para><b>Nothing here is a mock-up of the shell.</b> Every other figure in the catalog captures
/// one view; this one captures the thing those views live inside, which is what a reader needs
/// before any of them mean anything. It is the same window <c>App</c> shows, holding the same dock
/// tree, opened on a workspace through the same "open a workspace" command a double-click uses.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Three things had to be arranged, and each is load-bearing.</b></para>
///
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><b>A workspace to open.</b> There is no example workspace tracked in this repository
/// (<c>circuitRF_demo/</c> is git-ignored — see <see cref="DocFixtures"/>), so this fixture writes
/// one, into a temporary directory it deletes afterwards. It writes it through the real
/// <c>CellPersistence</c>/<c>SchematicPersistence</c>/<c>LayoutPersistence</c>/<c>WorkspacePersistence</c>
/// writers and fills it with the shipped schematic template and the shipped starter technology, so
/// the content is real and a format change breaks this loudly rather than quietly.</item>
///
/// <item><b>The window's DataContext, set on the CONTENT.</b> The capture renders the window's
/// content, not the <see cref="Window"/> (a captured window is wrapped in the generator's own
/// synthetic frame, §3.3). Detaching the content costs it the inherited DataContext, and the whole
/// dock tree is bound through it — the first capture came back as a toolbar over an empty grey
/// rectangle, with nothing reported, because <c>Layout</c> bound to nothing.</item>
///
/// <item><b>The in-window menu bar, forced visible.</b> It carries
/// <c>IsVisible="{OnPlatform True, macOS=False}"</c>, because macOS puts those menus in the system
/// menu bar, which is not in any visual tree and cannot be captured (§3.3). A figure generated on a
/// macOS machine would therefore be missing a menu bar that Windows and Linux readers have on
/// screen — and would silently differ from one generated on Linux. Forcing it on makes the figure
/// the same everywhere, and the page says where macOS puts it.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para><b>Determinism.</b> <see cref="WorkspaceViewModel"/>'s constructor reads the real
/// preferences file, so the capture would otherwise carry whoever generated it: their launch window
/// layout (this was visible — the Library panel moved columns), their colour scheme and their
/// installed PDKs in the palette. <c>tools/DocGen</c> redirects
/// <see cref="CircuitRF.Ui.AppDataRoot"/> to a throwaway directory before it starts, which is what
/// makes this a first-launch installation every time. The two remaining sources of run-to-run churn
/// are handled here: the message log is cleared of the absolute temporary paths it just logged, and
