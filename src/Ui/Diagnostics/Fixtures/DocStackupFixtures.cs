/// <b>The stackup, drawn in cross-section from a REAL technology</b> — the picture the Stackup
/// chapter is about.
///
/// <para>It is built from <see cref="StarterTechnologies.MmicGaAs"/> rather than from a hand-written
/// list of bands, for the reason every other figure in this folder is built from real objects: a
/// diagram that agrees only with itself would go on agreeing with itself after the shipped
/// technology changed. Every number in it — thickness, ε<sub>r</sub>, tanδ, which conductor is the
/// ground reference, which two layers a via spans — is read off the <c>Technology</c> the
/// application ships, so if that moves, the figure moves.</para>
///
/// <h3>R-stk8-7 — it is the APPLICATION'S renderer, not a second drawing of the same subject</h3>
/// <para>Every rectangle, band, barrel and label here comes out of <see cref="StackupScene"/> and
/// <see cref="StackupRenderer"/> in <c>src/Render</c>: the same layout pass and the same paint calls
/// the Technology Editor's Stackup tab makes every frame, and that <c>circuitrf render</c> and the
/// clipboard copy make. Until this brief there were two drawings of one thing — ~250 lines of
/// <c>Border</c>s and <c>TextBlock</c>s on a <c>Canvas</c> here, and the Skia renderer there — which
/// had to be kept looking alike by hand. That is the duplication <c>src/Render</c> exists to
/// prevent.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The hand-built figures were not broken, and the repoint was judged on the pictures, not
/// on the principle</b> — the three side-by-side comparisons, what each one gained and the one thing
/// each lost, are in <c>src/Ui/Diagnostics/RESOLVED.md</c>. The short version: the drawing now states
/// each via's SPAN, its fill and its wall, draws a plated barrel with its bore, and scales conductors
/// against each other, so the 0.25 µm capacitor plate no longer draws the same thickness as a 3 µm
/// interconnect metal. What it gives up is the room for a sentence: the ground reference reads "gnd"
/// and a tie reads "patterned: &lt;plate&gt;", where this file used to write both out in full. That is
/// <c>R-stk1-4</c> holding — the drawing carries no commentary — and both sentences moved into the
/// figure CAPTIONS in <see cref="FigureCatalog"/>, which is where a qualification belongs.</para>

/// technology, what window on it, and the footer sentence that sits outside the picture.</para>
