/// workspace at all: <c>HarmonicaView</c>'s own File ▸ Save has to work there. And it is not left in
/// the view either, which is where it used to live, because the document TAB's Save must reach a
/// document whose view may not be realized — a background tab's content is created on demand, so a
/// route that starts at the view is a route that silently does nothing on the tab the user actually
/// right-clicked.</para>

/// <para>The workspace is optional for the same reason: it is only needed to put a newly-saved
/// <c>.charm</c> into the project tree, which a standalone run has nothing to do.</para>
