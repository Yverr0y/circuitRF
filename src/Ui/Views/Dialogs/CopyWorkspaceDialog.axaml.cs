///
/// <para>The strongest product argument in the whole architecture, and once git is already being
/// driven as a subprocess it is nearly free: a public library of reference designs, opened in one
/// action, from any git host — with exchanging changes for those who want it, and copy-and-read for
/// somebody who only wants to look. It is also the mechanism RC-2's refusal points at: <b>the way to
/// edit a library is to open it as a workspace of its own</b>, which on a shared one is a copy plus a
/// send, or a request to its maintainer. Either way it is a deliberate act with a record.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Two fields, and nothing host-specific</b> (R-rc9-4). No account, no provider list, no
/// sign-in button: circuitRF binds to git, not to any hosting service, and whatever git accepts as an
/// address is what this accepts. <b>And no credential field</b> (§9.1) — circuitRF holds no sign-in
/// and asks for none; it uses whatever git on this machine is already configured with, and an address
/// that needs one git cannot supply produces a refusal naming what was wanted rather than a window
/// that never comes back.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Nothing here starts a process.</b> The dialog collects two strings and the caller does the
/// work, which is what lets the refusals be the caller's — and lets this be tested without a
/// network.</para>
