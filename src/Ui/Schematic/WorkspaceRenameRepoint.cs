// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  WorkspaceRenameRepoint — the references a workspace rename invalidates, and the
//  ones it can repair.
//
//  A workspace's name IS its folder name: `.cws` is a fixed filename and CwsFile
//  carries no name field. So renaming one is `Directory.Move`, and nothing inside it
//  notices — every intra-workspace reference (a CellRef, a layout's TechRef, a
//  .ccell's primaries, the .cws's own OpenDocuments) is relative and travels with the
//  folder.
//
//  What DOES notice is another workspace pointing IN. Four fields can, and all four
//  live in that other workspace's own `.cws`:
//     ReferencedWorkspaces[].Path   the alias table's target .cws
//     LibraryRefs[]                 a library folder
//     KnownFiles[]                  a bookmarked file or folder
//     PdkRefs[].Path                a kit folder
//  Each is stored workspace-relative when it is inside that workspace and absolute
//  otherwise (WorkspaceRefs.ToStoredRef), and BOTH forms break on a rename: relative
//  because two sibling projects address each other through the renamed segment,
//  absolute because the absolute path moved.
//
//  The ALIAS itself does not break, which is the part worth knowing: CwsWorkspaceRef
//  .Alias merely defaults to the folder name when the reference is created and is
//  independent of it thereafter, so every `ws://alias/…` reference inside the other
//  workspace's DOCUMENTS keeps resolving once the one Path line here is repaired.
//  That is exactly what CwsFile.ReferencedWorkspaces' own doc comment promises
//  ("relocating the other project is one edit here").
//
//  Rewriting another open workspace's `.cws` from this process is safe because
//  WriteWorkspaceFile re-reads the file before every save — its own comment says so:
//  "Load existing .cws to preserve KnownFiles + LibraryRefs (authoritative on disk)."
//  A workspace nobody has open cannot be reached at all, which the caller has to SAY
//  rather than implying a clean rename.
