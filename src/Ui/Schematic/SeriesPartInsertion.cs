/// <summary>
/// The wire a TWO-TERMINAL PART shorts out the moment it is placed, and the rule for when circuitRF
/// may clear it.
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> The natural gesture for putting a part in series is to drop it onto
/// the wire whose current is to go through it — at which point both of its pins land on that wire
/// and the part is shorted by the very run it was meant to break into. Every user then performs the
/// same second gesture: delete the stretch of wire between the two pins. This finds that stretch so
/// the placement can do it for them.</para>
///
/// <para><b>There is no list of kinds, and deliberately so.</b> It began as an IProbe affordance and
/// grew a second kind (the WSProbe) by the end of the same week; the list was the part that had to
/// be remembered, and a part left off it fails by doing nothing. What qualifies is asked
/// GEOMETRICALLY instead, here and nowhere else: exactly two pins, both landing on ONE straight
/// segment of wire. A part whose pins are not collinear with the run — a vertical R dropped on a
/// horizontal wire, an MBEND, whose two pins are at right angles — cannot satisfy it and never
/// triggers, so the gesture itself is the opt-in. R, L, C, NonlinearC, SRLC, a diode, a TLIN, a
/// 2-port SnP, a two-pin cell of the user's own and both series probes all reach it by the same
/// route.</para>
///
/// <para><b>A shorted part is worse than it looks</b>, which is why this is not cosmetic. A probe
/// that is shorted reports nothing — an IProbe reads no current, and a WSProbe's whole output is the
/// <c>wsp</c> matrix of a node it never split. A shorted R, L or C is quieter still: the design
/// SIMULATES, converges and returns a plausible answer with the part contributing nothing, and
/// nothing on the sheet says so because the wire and the part draw on top of each other. The
/// headless twin of the probe half of this rule is <c>check</c>'s <c>wsprobe.shorted</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The result must be electrically identical to the hand edit</b>, and that is the whole
/// constraint on <see cref="FindShortedSpans"/>. The cut is allowed only when the two pins sit on
/// ONE straight segment and the open stretch between them carries nothing else — no
/// junction dot, no other wire touching or crossing it, no other component's pin, no net label
/// anchored inside it. Anything in there is a connection to a third thing, and removing the copper
/// under it would re-partition the net rather than break it in series. In that case this returns
/// nothing and the placement behaves exactly as it always did; the user still has the manual route.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Several wires can carry the same run, and then every one of them is cut.</b> Two wires
/// drawn along the same line draw as ONE line, so a run that is doubled is invisible on the sheet —
/// and cutting only one of them leaves the other still shorting the part, which is why this used
/// to refuse the whole placement there rather than half-do it. Refusing was silent, and the sheet
/// gives the user nothing to look at, so the affordance simply stopped working on that run with no
/// way to find out why. Cutting the span out of ALL of them is the hand edit, exactly: the same
/// stretch of copper is gone from every wire that carried it. That it is safe is not a new
/// judgement — a second wire whose own vertex falls INSIDE the span is still refused below, so any
/// wire that reaches this point spans the whole cut and is in the same position as the first.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Placement only.</b> The callers are <c>SchematicViewModel.CommitPlacement</c> and
/// <c>CommitCellPlacementAsync</c> — the two commit paths, covering the click-arm, the
/// drag-and-drop and the cell/kit placements — so a later drag of a placed part reaches none of
/// this, and a paste or a type-change does not either. There is deliberately no "has this already
/// run" flag on the component: the entry points ARE the once.</para>
///
/// <para>Framework-free (no Avalonia), like <see cref="WireGeometry"/> — headless-testable.</para>
