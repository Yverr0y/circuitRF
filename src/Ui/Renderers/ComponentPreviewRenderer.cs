// The Avalonia adapter over CircuitRF.Render's ComponentPreviewRaster — two calls and one Wrap.
//
// The drawing itself moved below the UI firewall with every other renderer (R-rnd1-6): the fit
// solver, the pad markers and the raster surface are Skia and the design model, and nothing else.
// What could not move is the last step, which produces an Avalonia Bitmap for the dialog's Image to
// blit — and that split already existed, for exactly this reason, before there was a project to move
// the Skia half into.
//
// The comment that used to head the whole file — that this runs OFF the UI thread, and why that is
// safe — belongs with the drawing and travelled with it.
