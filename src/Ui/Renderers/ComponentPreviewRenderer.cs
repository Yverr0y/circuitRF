// Rasterizes an import-chooser preview OFF THE UI THREAD (owner, 2026-09-05: the dialog has to stay
// responsive while a preview is produced).
//
// ── The whole point of this file: the UI thread does not draw the preview ─────────────────────────
//
// A custom-draw control would put every one of these calls on the render pass of the dialog's own
// window — and a preview is not a cheap frame. Reading a component library, reconciling its layers
// and building a spatial index over a land pattern happen once per selection change, and the LAST
// thing that should stutter while the user arrows down a list of ninety candidates is the list
// itself. So the pane is a plain Image: this file produces a finished bitmap on a worker thread and
// the UI thread only blits it.
//
// That is safe because every object involved is preview-private. ComponentPreview.Build returns a
// freshly built Symbol and LayoutView reachable from nothing else, so the spatial index built here,
// the SKPath cache and the scratch Technology are touched by one thread only. The two static caches
// the renderers do share are a ConditionalWeakTable and a ConcurrentDictionary; the typefaces are
// Lazy<T> at its thread-safe default. Nothing here reads live editor state, and nothing here writes
// any.
