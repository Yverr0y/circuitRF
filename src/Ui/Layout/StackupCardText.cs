/// <para>R-stk6-8 states two constraints on the menu: <b>the labels are the card's labels, verbatim</b>,
/// and <b>the tooltips come with them</b>. "Metal thickness goes to:" was deliberately reworded away
/// from an earlier spelling that could not be answered without knowing what a conductor's z <i>band</i>
/// is — a word the control never defined — and re-inventing it in a second place is exactly how the
/// two come to ask different questions. A constant referenced from both is the only version of that
/// rule the next change cannot miss.</para>
///
/// <para>The .axaml reads these through <c>{x:Static}</c>, the same way it already reads
/// <see cref="TechEditorMetrics"/>'s pinned sizes — so this is not a second copy of the card's text,
/// it IS the card's text. It also collapses a duplication the card already carried: each of these
/// tooltips was written out twice there, once on the label and once on the control beside it, with a
/// comment asking that the two not drift.</para>

/// <h3>What is NOT here</h3>
/// <para>The drawing-layer rows' label, which is <c>StackupLayerRowViewModel.DrawingLayersLabel</c> —
