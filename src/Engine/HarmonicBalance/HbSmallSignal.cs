///
/// <para>At a converged HB operating point the nonlinear devices are periodically time-varying
/// conductances and capacitances. A vanishingly small stimulus at a frequency <c>ω_ss</c> that is in
/// general <b>not</b> on the HB grid therefore produces a response at every sideband
/// <c>ω_k = ω_ss + k·ω0</c>, and the linear system relating them is the conversion matrix
/// (S. A. Maas, <i>Nonlinear Microwave and RF Circuits</i>, 2nd ed., ch. 3; A. Suarez,
/// <i>Analysis and Design of Autonomous Microwave Circuits</i>, 2009, ch. 1–2). The WSProbe reads
/// the responses at <c>ω_ss</c> itself — the <c>k = 0</c> sideband — which is the large-signal
/// counterpart of the S-parameter <c>wsp</c>, and every derived metric of brief-wsprobe-2/3 applies
/// to it unchanged (T. A. Winslow, <i>General Circuit Analysis Using The WSProbe</i> (2023), §4.2:
/// "Linear analysis, harmonic balance, or AC analysis can all be accommodated").</para>
