/// Everything the WSProbe's harmonic-balance small-signal sweep can compute ONCE and reuse at every

///
/// <para><b>The whole argument in one line: the linear partition does not depend on the drive.</b>
/// WSP-5's straightforward path factors the linear partition <c>2·K_ss + 2</c> times per probe
/// frequency per operating point, so a 41-point drive sweep over a 991-point tickle grid at
/// <c>K_ss = 7</c> pays 609,465 sparse factorisations of the whole network — against 991 for the
/// S-parameter sweep of the same circuit. Every one of them is the same matrix it was at the
/// previous drive level. What genuinely changes with the operating point is the device spectra, and
/// those enter only the DENSE conversion matrix. So the sparse work moves here, is keyed by
/// frequency, and the per-operating-point work becomes dense-only (R-wsp8-3).</para>
///
/// <para><b>What is stored, per frequency (R-wsp8-1).</b> At a probe frequency <c>ω_ss</c> the
/// readings the document wants are <c>2N</c> entries of the solution vector — a branch current and a
/// node voltage per probe. Writing <c>R</c> for that <c>2N × n</c> selection of rows, the reading of
/// injection <c>p</c> is
/// <code>
///   r = R·M⁻¹·b_p + R·M⁻¹·B_int·(−I_nl,0)  =  W[p, ·] + T·(−I_nl,0)
/// </code>
/// and <c>R·M⁻¹</c> is <c>2N</c> ROWS of <c>M⁻¹</c>, each obtained by one solve against the
/// TRANSPOSED factorisation. The interface rows give <c>Z_NN</c> (hence <c>Y_NN</c>) and every
/// probe injection's open-circuit interface voltage at once, so the whole per-frequency block is
/// <c>N_int + 2N</c> transposed solves on ONE factorisation — replacing <c>4N</c> forward solves
/// plus <c>N_int</c> Z-column solves PER OPERATING POINT.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The transposed solve is HERMITIAN, and that is a trap.</b> CSparse's
/// <c>SparseLU.SolveTranspose</c> solves <c>Mᴴ y = b</c>, not <c>Mᵀ y = b</c> — measured here, not
/// assumed, because a real test matrix cannot tell the two apart. So the row of <c>M⁻¹</c> this code
/// wants is <c>conj(y)</c>, and the conjugation is applied at every read
/// (<see cref="Row"/>). Omitting it is a sign error on the imaginary part alone: every magnitude
/// stays right, so a Smith-chart plot looks plausible and only the phase is mirrored.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Reuse is verified, never declared (R-wsp8-4).</b> Each entry carries the VALUES of the
/// matrix it was computed from; the next use at that frequency re-stamps and compares them bit for
/// bit, exactly as <see cref="HbLinearExtractor"/> validates its own factorisations. A swept linear
/// element or a loadpull tuner override changes the matrix and the entry is recomputed; nothing else
/// can go stale and no caller has to remember to invalidate. The cost of that guarantee is one
