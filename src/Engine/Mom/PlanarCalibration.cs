// L8d — D4: THE CALIBRATION STANDARD IS CONSTRUCTED FROM THE DUT'S OWN MESH, NOT RE-MESHED.
//
// The two-line calibration is exact only insofar as the error box is the SAME OBJECT in the DUT and
// in the standard. That is not a tolerance, it is a construction — and a standard that is "the same
// line, re-meshed" is not the same error box, because L8b's grid spacing is derived from the WHOLE
// problem's narrowness per axis, so a bare rectangle and the feed of a bend do not get the same
// cells. The difference then shows up as a de-embedding residual that reads exactly like a
// convergence problem.
//
// So the standard is built here, cell by cell, from three things the port resolution already
// carries: the DUT's transverse gridlines across the port (verbatim), the DUT's own longitudinal
// cell run for the first K cells inward (verbatim, mirrored at the far end), and the DUT's bulk cell
// size to fill the middle. R-prt-5 asserts the result on COORDINATES, as an equality.
//
// Three consequences, all of them the point:
//   • the port's cell neighbourhood is identical, so the error box is the same object;
//   • SurfaceMesher is not touched — L8c's out-of-scope list keeps it closed and nothing here needs
//     it opened;
//   • R-msh-2's (LayerIndex, IY, IX) ordering contract is honoured by construction, because the
//     builder emits cells in exactly that order.
//
// The limitation this leaves, stated rather than discovered: the DUT's feed may have other metal
// near it that the standard does not. That is inherent to any two-line calibration — it is true of
// real TRL as well — and it is why PlanarPorts.CheckFeedClearance exists (R-prt-3) and why R-prt-4's
// feed-length study is the measurement that says how much clearance is enough.

// D5 — γ COMES FROM A 2×2 EIGENVALUE, IN CLOSED FORM
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// With T₁, T₂ the wave-cascade matrices of the two standards' raw S,
//
//     M = T₂ T₁⁻¹ = T_A · diag(e^{−γΔℓ}, e^{+γΔℓ}) · T_A⁻¹
//
// so e^{∓γΔℓ} are M's eigenvalues. And it collapses further than "the quadratic formula": a
// RECIPROCAL 2-port has det T = S₁₂/S₂₁ = 1, so det M = 1, so the two eigenvalues multiply to 1 and
//
//     cosh(γΔℓ) = ½·tr(M)
//
// EXACTLY — no discriminant, no eigensolver, no library. Same shape as L7b-b's own closed-form 2×2
// and for the same recorded reason.
//
// β is then known only modulo 2π/Δℓ, and that is CHECKED rather than assumed (R-prt-6): the branch
// is anchored at the lowest frequency, where βΔℓ ≪ π, and continued upward by predicting the next
// point's βΔℓ from the last one scaled by frequency.
