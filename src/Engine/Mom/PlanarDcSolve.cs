// LF1 — THE DC POINT, AND WHY IT IS NOT A FREQUENCY OF THE FULL-WAVE SWEEP.
//
// A user biasing a FET off an EM result needs the 0 Hz row of the `.sNp`, and needs it to be RIGHT
// about the one thing DC decides: whether the port is connected to anything. A series MIM cap is an
// OPEN at DC and a trace is very nearly a SHORT, and a file that guesses either way sends a bias
// current somewhere it does not go.
//
// **The full-wave kernel cannot produce it, and not because of a tolerance.** The MPIE splits into a
// vector-potential term that scales with ω and a scalar-potential term that scales with 1/ω, so at
// ω = 0 the system is not ill-conditioned, it is undefined — and every ingredient underneath is
// undefined with it: the Green's function is written in k₀, the DCIM path is a multiple of k₀, and
// the radial table is sized against a wavelength that does not exist. Dcim.CanFitAtFrequency refuses
// the neighbourhood for exactly these reasons.
//
// **What DC actually is, is a conduction problem.** At ω = 0 the charge term enforces ∇·J = 0 and the
// vector potential contributes nothing, so what is left is E = ZsJ on the metal with a divergence-free
// current — which is Ohm's law on a resistor network, and has an exact answer with no fit in it. The
// network is not a second discretisation of the structure: **it IS the rooftop basis**, one resistor
// per basis function, which is the same statement PlanarConductors already makes ("the basis list
// already IS the conduction graph of the meshed structure"). A cell pair that carries a rooftop
// conducts; one that does not, does not; a via basis crosses levels; a ground-attachment basis
// reaches the plane. Nothing here re-derives connectivity from the drawn polygons, because that
// second answer would disagree with the solve's wherever the mesher staircased, cut or dropped a
// sliver.
//
// **The ports are terminal PAIRS here, not delta gaps.** That is the one place this departs from the
// AC port model and it has to: a delta gap at a conductor's end face drives the structure against the
// plane through the FIELD, and at DC there is no field to drive it through — modelled as a source in
// series with its own rooftop it would see an open circuit at both ends of every line and publish
// S = I for a solid piece of copper. What an edge port IS at DC is the end of that conductor against
// its reference, which is the plane; so the terminals are the conductor's end cells and the ground
// node, and the answer comes out as the trace's own resistance. The kinds that genuinely ARE a cut in
// metal — the internal delta gap, and the via-to-plane port whose gap is at the foot of the via — cut
// the network, because that is what they are.
//
// **And a pair is a PAIR: neither terminal of a cut port is the ground node.** An edge port's − IS
// the plane, so the two statements coincide there and it is easy to write a solve that only works
// for them — which is what this file did until 2026-09-14, by holding every terminal at an absolute
// potential. That is the short-circuit condition ONLY under a common reference; on a delta gap it
// welds the far lip to ground and the port stops conserving current across itself. So each port is
// driven by a source across its own terminal pair (`Admittance`), which says nothing about where
// either terminal sits, and a port is treated as a CONNECTION when asking what can reach what —
// a cut's two lips are in different conduction components by construction, so branch connectivity
// alone declares everything past a gap unreachable.
