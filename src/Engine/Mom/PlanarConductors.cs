// PCAL2 — WHICH PIECE OF METAL IS WHICH, ON THE MESH RATHER THAN ON THE ARTWORK.
//
// The port-calibration clearance check has to answer two questions about a cell of metal near a
// port: is it the port's OWN conductor, and if it is not, does it carry a port of its own. PCAL1
// measured that the second answer is worth a factor of 2-3 in the clearance a port needs
// (`src/Engine/Mom/RESOLVED.md`, "PCAL1"), and the first is what keeps the check off a taper's own
// flare — which is R-fed-1's job and not a neighbour at all.
//
// **The connectivity comes from the BASES, not from the polygons.** A rooftop basis exists for
// exactly those pairs of adjacent cells that are both metal, so the basis list already IS the
// conduction graph of the meshed structure — including a via's ẑ basis, which joins two levels.
// Re-deriving it from the drawn polygons would be a second answer to a question the mesh has
// already answered, and the two would disagree wherever the mesher staircased, cut or dropped a
// sliver. What the solve drives is cells, so what "the same conductor" means is cells — the same
// rule `PlanarPortCrossSection` states for the port profile one file over.
