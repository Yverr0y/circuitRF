// CL1 — THE SURFACE IMPEDANCE OF A CONDUCTOR, AND THE TWO LIMITS THAT MAKE IT LOAD-BEARING.
//
// Until this file existed, kernel B's metal was a PERFECT CONDUCTOR: PlanarConductorLayer.SigmaSm
// and ThicknessM reached PlanarProblem, entered the provenance hash, and were never read by the
// fill. On the MMIC technology this repository ships that omits 92-99% of the line's loss
// (brief-conductor-loss-0-overview.md §0). This file is the scalar; PlanarFill is where it is used.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE FORMULATION — A TERM IN THE EFIE, NOT A POST-PROCESSING CORRECTION
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// A surface-impedance boundary condition replaces "E_tan = 0 on the metal" with "E_tan = Z_s·J", so
// the electric-field integral equation becomes
//
//     Z_s(ω)·J(r) + jωA(r) + ∇Φ(r) = E_inc(r)
//
// and testing with f_m (Galerkin, the same D1 the rest of the fill uses) adds exactly one term:
//
//     Z[m,n] += Z_s(ω, layer of m) · ⟨f_m , f_n⟩          when m and n share a layer.
//
// The ALTERNATIVE — solve PEC, then integrate R_s|J|² over the answer — is cheaper and is wrong in
// the way that matters: the PEC current has an unregularised 1/√d edge singularity, so ∫R_s|J|² over
// it is logarithmically divergent in the edge mesh and the number depends on EdgeCells. Loading the
// operator penalises that singular edge current self-consistently. (It does not remove the
// convergence question — PlanarSurfaceImpedanceTests' edge sweep is where that is MEASURED — but it
// is the difference between a quantity that converges slowly and one that does not converge at all.)
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE SCALAR, DERIVED
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Inside a good conductor the field obeys ∂²E/∂n² = γ_c²E with
//
//     γ_c = √(jωµ₀σ) = (1+j)/δ ,     δ = √(2/(ωµ₀σ))          (the skin depth)
//     η_c = γ_c/σ    = (1+j)/(σδ)                              (the intrinsic impedance)
//
// For a slab of thickness t excited SYMMETRICALLY on both faces — which is what a single-unknown
// sheet model means — the tangential field is even about the mid-plane, E ∝ cosh(γ_c z), the current
// density is σE, and the ratio of the surface field to the TOTAL sheet current
// K = ∫σE dz = 2σE(t/2)·sinh(γ_c t/2)/γ_c is
//
//     Z_s(ω) = E(t/2)/K = (η_c/2)·coth(γ_c t/2).                                             (CL1.1)
//
// TWO LIMITS, AND BOTH ARE LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN DECORATIVE:
//
//   t ≫ δ →  coth → 1, so Z_s → η_c/2 = (1+j)/(2σδ).  Two surfaces in parallel — the classic
//            R_s = 1/(σδ) per face, and the factor of two is the second face, not a slip.
//
//   t ≪ δ →  coth(x) → 1/x + x/3, so Z_s → (η_c/2)·(2/(γ_c t)) = 1/(σt), which is EXACTLY
//            PlanarDcSolve.SheetResistance. So the AC term walks continuously into the DC point the
//            kernel already computes, and LF2's conduction-substitution band below the DCIM fit
//            floor stops being a discontinuity in α.
//
// σ ≤ 0 OR t ≤ 0 IS A PEC AND RETURNS EXACTLY Complex.Zero. That is what every other part of this
// kernel already means by those values (PlanarDcSolve.cs's SheetResistance says the same), and it is
// what makes the PEC reproduction gate BIT-IDENTICAL rather than approximate: adding Complex.Zero to
// a matrix entry changes no bits.
//
// THE coth's LARGE-ARGUMENT BRANCH IS A PRECISION QUESTION, NOT A CRASH. The naive
// (e^{2z}+1)/(e^{2z}-1) does not overflow until t/δ > 710 and no shipped stackup reaches that —
// 105 µm copper at 40 GHz is t/δ = 318 — but past |z| ≈ 30 the ratio is 1 to every bit that matters
// and the subtraction in the denominator is pure cancellation noise. The large-argument branch is
// returned there rather than computed.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT THIS FORM CANNOT CARRY, SAID HERE RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// (CL1.1) is EXACT for symmetric excitation and is the standard single-unknown reduction otherwise.
// A microstrip's substrate-side face carries far more current than its air-side face; ONE unknown
// per location cannot hold two independent face currents, and that asymmetry is precisely the
// information a single sheet loses. The related thickness-blindness is measured in the series
// overview §3: over the thickness range real stackups use, Re(Z_s) is flat to 0.1% (FR-4) / 5%
// (GaAs) while kernel A's true loss moves by 1.41× and 1.43×. Thick metal is deliberately NOT a
// brief in this series and §3 gives the four reasons.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// CL4 — THE GROUND PLANE IS NOT A STRIP, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS A FACTOR OF TWO
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The laterally infinite plane the Green's function terminates on has AIR BELOW IT and carries its
// return current on its upper face alone, so neither of (CL1.1)'s two halvings applies:
//
//     Z_plane(ω) = η_c · coth(γ_c t) .                                                     (CL4.1)
//
// Same two limits, one-sided: η_c = (1+j)/(σδ) when t ≫ δ, and 1/(σt) when t ≪ δ. Reaching for
// Sheet() here would report half the ground's loss — smoothly, plausibly, and with every gate in
// this file still green, which is why the brief names it as the first place a factor of two can
// enter unseen.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE VIA BARREL IS NOT A SHEET
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// A z-directed basis is a barrel, not a sheet: its current crosses the footprint AREA and returns
// through the barrel WALL, so the quantity is a SERIES impedance in ohms rather than an ohms-per-
// square multiplying a Gram entry. For a post of length ℓ, footprint area A and footprint perimeter
// P the current at high frequency rides the wall over the perimeter, and at DC it fills the area:
//
//     Z_barrel = (ℓ/P) · η_c · coth(γ_c·t_eff) ,     t_eff = A/P.                           (CL1.2)
//
// This is the ONE-SIDED form (no ½, coth's argument not halved) because a solid post conducts on one
// face only. Its limits are the two that have to hold:
//
//   t_eff ≫ δ →  Z_barrel → ℓ·(1+j)/(σδP) — the brief's own spelling, current on the wall alone.
//   t_eff ≪ δ →  Z_barrel → (ℓ/P)·1/(σ·A/P) = ℓ/(σA), which is EXACTLY
//                PlanarDcSolve's ViaResistance for the same basis. That equality is what gates the
//                via arm (R-cl1-5) and it is an identity rather than a tolerance.
//
// Nothing here knows about a mesh, a Green's function or a frequency sweep: it is σ, t and ω.
