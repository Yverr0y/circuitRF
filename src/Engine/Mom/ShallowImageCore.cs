// MIM-8 — the cell-pair integral of a SHALLOW image's static kernel, in the form the fill can use.

// WHAT THIS IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A BETTER QUADRATURE
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// §MIM-3 measured the cross-level block of the multi-level fill losing four decades between
// cell/separation 1 and 20, and named the mechanism: at d ≪ cell the kernel carries a peak of width
// d inside a cell of width h, and a rule that treats the pair as smooth integrates straight over it.
// §MIM-8 located the peak exactly. It is not the kernel and it is not the extracted asymptotes — a
// cross-REGION pair has none (LayeredSpectralGreens.AsymptoticAtHeights returns zero coefficients for
// one, by design) — it is a FITTED IMAGE whose depth is of the order of the film thickness. On the
// shipped MMIC stack, with a 0.2 µm capacitor dielectric, the scalar kernel's cross-level fit puts an
// image of amplitude 0.144 at a depth of 0.128 µm, i.e. 0.05 of a 2.5 µm cell.
//
// FromDcimAtHeights treats every image as smooth and moves only its value at ρ = 0 into the constant.
// That is right while the depth is large against a cell — R-fil-8 says so in as many words, and
// PlanarKernelTerms.SmallestImageDepth exists to let the claim be checked — and it is wrong here.
//
// The treatment is the one the via z-integral already uses one dimension up: SUBTRACT the offending
// term's static part and put it back in CLOSED FORM. What that needs is this file's one function —
// the pulse-weighted mean of 1/√(ρ² + b²) over a pair of rectangular cells. Outer Gauss on the fill's
// own graded rule, inner closed form, exactly as PlanarFill.CellPairCores does it in the plane and as
// ViaZIntegral.MeanAtOffset does it at a real offset. The only thing new is that b is COMPLEX, which
// is what a fitted depth is.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH. The VECTOR block carries the same peak and does not need this: measured on
// MIM-3's own plate ladder, the vector half of the cross-level error is 1.7e-6 at cell/separation 50
// where the total is 3.2e-1 — five decades down, because at these dimensions the scalar half is
// 1/(ω²ε₀µ₀A) larger. Adding the ramp-weighted moments at a complex offset would be arithmetic with
// nothing at the end of it, so it was measured and not built. §MIM-8 in HISTORY.md carries the table.
