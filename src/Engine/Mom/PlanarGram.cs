// CL1 — THE GRAM MATRIX ⟨f_m, f_n⟩ OF THE ROOFTOP BASIS.
//
// The surface-impedance boundary condition adds exactly one Galerkin term to the EFIE,
//
//     Z[m,n] += Z_s(ω, layer) · ⟨f_m , f_n⟩ ,      ⟨f_m, f_n⟩ = ∫ f_m·f_n dS
//
// and this file is the second factor. See PlanarSurfaceImpedance's header for the first.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// IT IS REAL, FREQUENCY-INDEPENDENT AND SPARSE, AND ALL THREE MATTER
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// REAL and FREQUENCY-INDEPENDENT: f is a geometric weight, so this is built ONCE per mesh beside the
// D6 cores and scaled by one complex scalar per frequency. If the conductor-loss term is ever
// MEASURABLE against an O(N²) fill and an O(N³) factorisation, this is being rebuilt per frequency,
// which it must not be — PlanarSurfaceImpedanceTests gates the cost as a COUNTER rather than a wall
// clock, on this area's own rule about timing tests.
//
// SPARSE, and the shape is exact rather than approximate:
//
//   • f_m·f_n ≡ 0 for a mixed X/Y pair (L8c's D5 — a rooftop is purely x̂ or purely ŷ), so the Gram
//     is block-diagonal by direction exactly as the vector block is.
//   • f_m is zero outside its own two cells, so ⟨f_m, f_n⟩ is zero unless m and n SHARE a cell. A
//     cell carries at most one X rooftop reaching left and one reaching right, so a basis has at
//     most two same-direction partners and the Gram has ~3N nonzeros — measured and reported as a
//     multiple of N rather than assumed.
//   • Two cells on different LEVELS are different cells, so a cross-layer pair contributes nothing
//     and no level pairing has to be resolved. Every entry's shared cells are on ONE level, which is
//     the level whose Z_s multiplies it.
//   • A VERTICAL (via) basis is deliberately NOT here. Its current crosses a footprint and returns
//     through a barrel WALL, which is a series impedance in ohms rather than an ohms-per-square
//     times a Gram entry — PlanarSurfaceImpedance.Barrel, and the via arm of the fill.
//
// SYMMETRIC: ⟨f_m, f_n⟩ = ⟨f_n, f_m⟩ identically, so only j ≥ i is stored and R-fil-2's
// "computed on m ≤ n and mirrored" is untouched, as is P7's complex-symmetric factorisation.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE INTEGRAL, PER SHARED CELL
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// On one cell both weights are NON-NEGATIVE — the sign that distinguishes a rooftop's two halves
// belongs to the DIVERGENCE, not to the current (PlanarBasisFunctions) — so there is no sign
// bookkeeping here at all and the diagonal is strictly positive.
//
// WHOLE RECTANGLE (every Manhattan cell, i.e. nearly all of them). With Δ the cell's extent along
// the flow direction, L its transverse extent and A = Δ·L, the weight is |u − e|/A with e the
// half's own OUTER edge, so
//
//     ∫ w_m w_n dS = (L/A²)·∫₀^Δ ξ_m ξ_n du  =  Δ/(3L)   when the two halves share an outer edge
//                                               Δ/(6L)   when they do not (one ramp rising, one
//                                                         falling — the only other case, because a
//                                                         cell carries at most one rooftop per side)
//
// Both are elementary: ∫₀^Δ u² du = Δ³/3 and ∫₀^Δ u(Δ−u) du = Δ³/6.
//
// CUT CELL (PlanarCellRegion != null). The weight is the cell's own piecewise-affine profile
// (RooftopSupport — a list of STRIPS carrying w = (αx + βy + γ)/Area), so the product of two weights
// is a QUADRATIC over each strip and needs the plain integral, both first moments and the three
// SECOND moments. The first three already existed (PolygonIntegrals.Area/AreaMoment); the second
// moments are PolygonIntegrals.AreaSecondMoments, the one new closed form CL1 needed.
//
// THE TWO SUPPORTS' STRIPS ARE THE SAME STRIPS, AND THAT IS WHY THEY CAN BE PAIRED BY INDEX.
// RooftopSupport.Build takes its breakpoints from the REGION and the flow DIRECTION alone — not from
// which side the shared face is on — so two same-direction bases meeting on one cut cell get rings
// that are equal element for element and differ only in (α, β, γ). Pairing them by index is
// therefore exact rather than an alignment assumption, and it is asserted rather than trusted.
//
// The moments are taken about the cell's own CENTRE rather than about the origin: a cell 60 mm down
// a taper has coordinates ~1e-1 and extents ~1e-5, and ∫u² about the origin would be a difference of
// numbers 1e8 times the answer.
