// L8d follow-up (2026-08-12) — the uniform feed a calibrated port needs, built by the SOLVER
// instead of demanded of the user's artwork.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THIS EXISTS. IT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE — WITHOUT IT A TAPER READS AS AN OPEN CIRCUIT
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// D6's peel forms the de-embedded wave matrix as
//
//     y_ij = (S_meas,ij − δ_ij·a₁₁) / (a₂₁(i)·a₂₁(j))
//
// and a₁₁ — the delta gap's EXTERNAL reflection — is measured on a calibration standard, which is an
// ISOLATED UNIFORM LINE of the port's own cross-section (D4). The diagonal is therefore a difference
// of two numbers that both sit within a few 1e-4 of unity, divided by a₂₁², and a₂₁ ∝ ω (the port is
// necessarily a series delta gap). On the owner's 50 → 12 Ω Klopfenstein taper at 1 GHz that divisor
// is 9.8e-5: the peel multiplies any error in a₁₁ by ~10⁴.
//
// So a₁₁ has to be RIGHT to about 1e-5, and it is only right if the DUT's metal actually looks like
// the standard for the distance the standard replaces. When the artwork starts changing width at the
// reference plane — every taper, every Klopfenstein, every part whose port sits on a flare — it does
// not, and the failure is not a mild inaccuracy:
//
//     MKlopf, 2000 mil, 50 → 12 Ω, drawn with the port on the taper's own end face
//       de-embedded  |S₁₁| = 1.0000 … 1.0235,  |S₂₁| = 0.0008 … 0.11,  Σ|S|² up to 1.06
//       the same part with 2 mm of uniform lead
//       de-embedded  |S₁₁| = 0.44,   |S₂₁| = 0.89,  Σ|S|² = 0.992   (and it tracks the analytic model)
//
// A non-passive answer that reads as a perfect open is what a user got, with no refusal.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT IT DOES
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Before meshing, each port's own polygon is EXTENDED outward from its drawn end face by however
// much uniform line the calibration is short of — never more, and nothing at all when the drawn feed
// is already uniform for that distance. The lead is part of the artwork the fill sees, so it is real
// metal with real coupling; afterwards it is removed EXACTLY, because it is a uniform section of the
// port's own cross-section and γ is a quantity the calibration already measured (<see cref="Peel"/>).
//
// **The user's reference plane therefore lands on the DRAWN metal edge**, which is where §10.6 says
// it lands and where a user reading a plot assumes it lands. Nothing about the artwork changes, no
// setting is introduced, and a `.clay` that produced a good answer before produces a BIT-IDENTICAL
// one now (no shortfall ⇒ no lead ⇒ the same problem object).
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Every case it is not certain about is DECLINED rather than guessed, and declining costs nothing:
// it is exactly the behaviour that shipped before this file existed, warning included
// (`PlanarPorts.CheckFeedClearance`). The declines are: a port whose level cannot be determined from
// geometry alone; an end face that is not a single straight segment (so there is no unambiguous
// cross-section to extrude); and a lead that would run into other metal on the same level. Guessing
// any of those would move metal the user drew, which is a worse failure than the one being fixed.
