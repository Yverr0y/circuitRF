// QSC — γ AND Z_c FOR A CALIBRATION STANDARD, FROM ITS OWN ELECTROSTATICS
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// D5 MEASURES γ from two full-wave line standards, and that is the right instrument at the top of a
// band: it captures dispersion, the port's own discontinuity and higher-order effects with no
// quasi-TEM assumption. What it costs is 1/f_lo, because the two lines' length difference has to sit
// inside TRL's usable interval βΔℓ ∈ [20°, 160°]. On a 3.8 mm microstrip swept from 100 MHz that
// bought a 161.5 mm standard — 42× the DUT, 79,055 unknowns against a 12,000 ceiling — and the run
// refused. `RESOLVED.md` §RAW1 §6.
//
// **Supplying γ does NOT by itself remove the long standards, and that is the trap this file's brief
// was written to close.** γ is ALREADY an input to `PlanarDeembed.SolveErrorBox`; the error box still
// needs TWO lines, because one line gives two complex equations (M₁₁, M₂₁) for three complex unknowns
// (a₁₁, a₂₁², a₂₂) and no reciprocity or symmetry argument closes that gap.
//
// **What a known γ buys is that Δℓ no longer has to be ELECTRICALLY long.** The [20°, 160°] interval
// protects the γ EXTRACTION, where `Acosh`'s branch structure makes βΔℓ = nπ a genuine singularity
// and where (per `PlanarCalibration.Gamma`'s own header) α is two orders below β and its extracted
// sign is noise. The error box's own conditioning degrades as 1/Δℓ — ordinary conditioning, not a
// denominator zero — so Δℓ can be sized from the SUBSTRATE and the mesh instead of from the
// wavelength, and both standards become small and frequency-independent.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// R-qsc-2 — THE STANDARD'S OWN ELECTROSTATICS, NOT `RlgcExtractor`, AND IT IS NOT A PREFERENCE
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The two candidate suppliers are kernel A's per-unit-length cross-section solve
// (`RlgcExtractor.Extract`) and the standard's own electrostatics. They are not the same quantity:
// the first describes the DUT's DRAWN cross-section, the second describes the STANDARD — the object
// the error box is actually solved from. Four reasons the second wins, and the first is structural:
//
//   • **`PlanarDeembed`'s own D7 rule already says so**: "Kernel A is the ORACLE for Z_c, never an
//     input. Reading Z_c or C_pul off QuasiStaticKernel and feeding it into B would make the phase
//     table's own 'A and B agree on a uniform line' gate a tautology and would import A's
//     discretisation error into B's answer." A γ taken from A is the same sentence one quantity over.
//   • **De-embedding is ALREADY part quasi-static**: `PlanarDeembed.CapacitancePerMetre` runs an
//     electrostatic solve on the two standards and supplies C_pul for Z_c = γ/(jωC_pul). This adds
//     ONE further solve of the same kind — the same geometry with the dielectric removed — and reads
//     L = μ₀ε₀/C₀ off it. Nothing new is introduced; an existing route is extended by its other half.
//   • **Kernel A cannot represent what a standard can.** A coplanar standard's C_pul is a MODAL
//     capacitance (RP-2c), a widened one carries a FLOATING conductor (PCAL3), and a group's is a
//     MATRIX (PCAL4/D7'). All three ride on `PlanarStandard`'s own `ModePotential`/`ModeWeight`/
//     `FloatingPotential` and are honoured here for free, because this is the same solve. Kernel A
//     would need a cross-section it does not have, and a WIDTH that is not defined for a feed that
//     is not a plain rectangle.
//   • **It is self-consistent in the discretisation.** C and C₀ come off the SAME mesh, so
//     ε_eff = C/C₀ and Z_c = √(L/C) share their discretisation error and it cancels to first order in
//     the ratio — which is exactly the argument D7 already makes for DIFFERENCING two standards
//     rather than solving one.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE ARITHMETIC
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
//     C   = C′ − jC″   from the standards' differencing with the real dielectric (complex ε*)
//     C₀  =            the same differencing with every dielectric replaced by vacuum
//     L   = μ₀ε₀/C₀    the quasi-TEM identity — `RlgcExtractor`'s own [L] = μ₀ε₀[C₀]⁻¹, N = 1
//     γ   = jω√(LC)    so α = ω√(LC′)·tanδ_eff/2 and β = ω√(LC′) fall out together
//     Z_c = γ/(jωC′)   D7's OWN spelling, unchanged — only γ's source changed
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// CL3 — THE METAL IS NO LONGER A PERFECT CONDUCTOR HERE, AND R COMES OFF THIS SOLVE'S OWN CHARGE
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// This file shipped saying "the metal is a PERFECT CONDUCTOR here, exactly as it is in the full-wave
// fill by default", which was true while CL1's `PlanarFillSettings.ConductorLoss` was off.
// `brief-conductor-loss-3-default-and-gate.md` turns it on, and leaving γ lossless below the
// crossover would have been loud in exactly one place and silent everywhere else: the standards are
// still solved FULL-WAVE, so their S carries α_c while a lossless γ does not. **On the shipped MMIC
// technology the crossover is 26.07 GHz, so that is not a corner of the band — it is all of it**, and
// α_c is 92-99 % of a GaAs line's loss. A published α four times too small, smooth and plausible, is
// the failure mode this whole directory keeps writing headers about.
//
//     R = Σ_levels Re(Z_s(ω, σ, t)) · [ ΔS_level · Δℓ / |ΔT|² ]
//     S = Σ_cells |q|²/A   (C²/m²)        T = Σ_cells q   (C)        Δ = long − short
//     γ = √( (R + jωL)(jωC) )
//
// **S and T come off the SAME differencing, the SAME two solves and the SAME mesh as C**, which is
// what makes this the third candidate rather than a fourth loss model. The derivation is the TEM
// identity K = v_p·q_s: P′ = ½Re(Z_s)∫|K|²dx and P′ = ½R|I|², so R = Re(Z_s)·∫|q_s|²dx/(∫q_s dx)²
// and v_p cancels. Differencing the two standards is what turns the surface integrals into
// per-metre ones and cancels both end effects exactly, one quantity over from D7's own C_pul.
//
// **R-cl3-0 — THE DECISION WAS MEASURED, AND THE TWO REJECTED CANDIDATES ARE REJECTED BY NUMBER AS
// WELL AS BY DOCTRINE.** α_c out of kernel B's own two lossy standards (the lossy extraction minus
// the PEC one, CL1's own instrument) against the two suppliers, at four frequencies and four meshes:
//
//     supplier                       FR-4 overlap        GaAs coarse      GaAs refined
//     this one (static charge)       0.963-0.990×        0.999-1.010×     1.059-1.147×
//     kernel A's Wheeler term        1.32-1.75×          1.52-1.72×       1.20-1.37×
//
// The static charge tracks the fill's own term to a few per cent AND MOVES WITH THE MESH THE WAY IT
// DOES — turning the edge mesh on raises both by ~32 % on FR-4, where kernel A does not move at all
// because it is a different discretisation of a different formulation. That is the whole argument:
// this is not a better model of the metal, it is the SAME model the fill loaded, read off the same
// mesh, so the two agree across the crossover by construction rather than by calibration.
//
// **Kernel A stays the ORACLE and is still not an input** — R-qsc-2's first bullet and D7's rule,
// unchanged. Its 20-75 % over-read against the fill is not an error in kernel A; it is §CL1's own
// measured 0.63 (FR-4) / 0.73 (GaAs) single-sheet deficit seen from the other side, and importing it
// here would have made both `docs/design/mom-engine.md` §10.9's A-vs-B gate and the crossover's own
// continuity tautologies at once.
//
// **What this does NOT claim.** The static distribution is the UNLOADED one, so its edge crowding is
// not regularised the way the loaded EFIE's is (series overview §1) — which is where the refined-mesh
// GaAs over-read of 6-15 % comes from, and it is reported rather than tuned. It is bounded, not
// divergent, because the mesh that resolves the singularity is the same mesh the fill's own term is
// integrated on.
//
// **Null `Conductor` is the PEC reading and is bit-identical to what shipped**, on exactly the terms
// `PlanarFillSettings.ConductorLoss` null is: `GammaAt` keeps the old `jω√(LC)` expression rather
// than the equivalent `√(jωL·jωC)`, so a run with `PlanarFillSettings.PerfectConductor` set
// reproduces every number QSC recorded.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// CL7 — AND THE GROUND PLANE IS A REAL CONDUCTOR NOW, SO γ NEEDS ITS TERM TOO
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The block above is CL3's, and its sum is over MESHED LEVELS. `brief-conductor-loss-7` makes the
// extractor write a conducting floor, and the plane is not a meshed level: it is laterally infinite,
// unmeshed, and has no ΔS of its own. Left alone, a GaAs line's published S would carry a ground
// term at every frequency and the γ its error box is solved against would carry one at none of them
// — and on the shipped MMIC technology the quasi-static path is the WHOLE band.
//
//     R_ground = Re(Z_plane(ω, σ, t)) · [ ΔS_g · Δℓ / |ΔT|² ] ,   S_g = Σ_ij q_i q̄_j K(d_ij)
//     K(d)     = h / (π (4h² + d²)^{3/2})                          (PlanarGroundReturn)
//
// **Off the SAME two solves and the SAME mesh**, from the same charge vector, so CL3 §1's whole
// argument transfers. Three things about it are worth having here rather than one file over:
//
//   • **It is a SEPARATE object from `Conductor` and that is load-bearing.**
//     `PlanarFillSettings.PerfectConductor` makes the STRIP perfect and nothing else, because the
//     plane is a termination of the Green's function and not a member of the fill (§CL4 §8). Folding
//     the ground in would have made that flag turn the plane perfect here and not in the full-wave
//     kernel — the exact asymmetry that ate CL4's own first measurement.
//   • **Re(Z_s) is the ONE-SIDED `PlanarSurfaceImpedance.Plane`**, read through the floor itself, so
//     this path and CL6's kernel cannot come to mean different metal. A level's two-sided `Sheet`
//     would halve it.
//   • **It is the RETURN CURRENT's distribution, not the induced CHARGE's.** Those are two different
//     things in an inhomogeneous line and the charge one over-reads by 1.56× on FR-4 and 1.87× on
//     GaAs — the measurement and the reason are in `PlanarGroundReturn`'s own header.
//
// Measured against the fill's own ground term (the lossy-floor two-line extraction minus the PEC one,
// strip perfect on both sides) at four frequencies and four meshes on both starters: **0.887-0.983×**,
// drifting down the band exactly as §CL4 §7's k₀H finding predicts. `RESOLVED.md` §CL7.
//
// **A PERFECT floor produces no `Ground` at all rather than one whose R is zero**, on the same rule
// the paragraph above states for `Conductor`: a `+ 0.0` would put a PEC-ground run on the other
// spelling of γ and move it by an ulp, which is exactly enough to stop `PerfectGround` being an
// oracle. And **MIM-4's interior route supplies NO ground term** — `GroundTermSupplied` says so, and
// `PlanarSolve`'s own calibration note reports the residue rather than leaving it to be assumed.
//
// **C stays COMPLEX all the way to γ and that is not decoration.** `PlanarKernelTerms.StaticScalar`
// is built on `GroundedSlab.EpsComplex`, so the charge already carries tanδ; D7 drops it with a
// `.Real` because Z_c takes a double. Dropping it here would publish α = 0 on a lossy board — a
// plausible, wrong number, and one that would read as a regression against the measured path beside
// it in the same `.npy`.
