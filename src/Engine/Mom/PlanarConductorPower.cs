// CL2 — P_conductor STOPS BEING AN IDENTICAL ZERO.
//
// ANT-5 itemised where a driven port's accepted power goes and had to book one of its four terms as a
// hard zero, because kernel B's metal was a perfect conductor. CL1 put the surface impedance INTO the
// EFIE; this file reads the answer back out as a power, and PlanarPowerBudget subtracts it from the
// dielectric residual.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THERE IS EXACTLY ONE ROUTE TO THIS NUMBER, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THE FILE
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The quantity is the ordinary dissipation in a surface impedance,
//
//     P_conductor = ½ ∫ Re(Z_s) |J|² dS   +   Σ_barrels ½ Re(Z_barrel) |I|²
//
// and with J = Σ_n x_n f_n it is NOT a new integral at all. Expanding,
//
//     ∫ |J|² dS = Σ_{m,n} x_m* x_n ∫ f_m·f_n dS = xᴴ G x ,     G = PlanarGram
//
// so the sheet term is a QUADRATIC FORM in the solved coefficient vector against the SAME Gram matrix
// CL1 built for the fill, one Re(Z_s) per conductor level:
//
//     P_sheet = ½ Σ_{m,n on level L} Re(Z_s^L) · Re(x_m* x_n) · G[m,n] .
//
// It costs one sparse product. It needs no new geometry, no new quadrature and no second
// discretisation of the metal — and that is deliberate rather than merely convenient: **a second
// route to the same number is how a factor of two gets in.** Every scalar here comes from the two
// objects the FILL used (PlanarGram and PlanarConductorLoss), so a loss term in the matrix and a loss
// term in the budget cannot mean different things. The test project builds the direct
// ∫Re(Z_s)|J|² over PlanarCurrentDensity's map as an independent reference; that route is a GATE and
// it does not ship.
//
// THE TRIANGLE IS STORED ONCE AND COUNTED TWICE. G is real symmetric and PlanarGram holds only
// j ≥ i, so the diagonal contributes |x_i|²·G[i,i] and each off-diagonal slot contributes
// 2·Re(x_i* x_j)·G[i,j]. Dropping the 2 is precisely the factor-of-two failure the gate exists for,
// and it would be invisible: the budget would still sum to P_accepted, because the dielectric
// residual absorbs whatever this term gets wrong.
//
// THE IMAGINARY PART IS DISCARDED, AND IT IS EXACTLY ZERO BEFORE IT IS. xᴴGx is a real number for
// Hermitian G (and G here is real symmetric), so Im(x_i* x_j)·G[i,j] cancels against its transpose
// slot. Only Re(Z_s) is read: the reactive part of the surface impedance is internal INDUCTANCE, it
// stores energy rather than absorbing it, and folding it in here would report a stored energy as a
// loss.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// A VIA BARREL IS NOT A SHEET, HERE EITHER
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// PlanarSurfaceImpedance's header says why Z_barrel is a SERIES impedance in ohms rather than an
// ohms-per-square: a barrel's current crosses a footprint AREA and returns through the wall. The fill
// adds it straight to the Z_zz diagonal with no Gram weight, so a vertical basis's coefficient is the
// whole barrel current in amperes and its dissipation is the elementary ½Re(Z)|I|². A vertical basis
// has no row in the Gram at all (PlanarGram's header), so the two arms cannot double-count each other.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHEN THE METAL IS A PERFECT CONDUCTOR THIS IS A HARD ZERO, AND THAT IS NOT A SPECIAL CASE
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Two different runs report zero here and they mean different things, which is why
// PlanarPowerBudget.ConductorModelled is carried beside the number:
//
//   • The FILL had no conductor-loss term (PlanarFillSettings.ConductorLoss is null — CL1's PEC
//     oracle, and still the default). The solved current belongs to a PEC structure and P_accepted
//     contains no metal loss, so computing a term from it would be a fiction the dielectric residual
//     would then have to pay for with a NEGATIVE number. Nothing here is even constructed.
//   • The fill HAD the term and the stackup declares PEC metal (σ ≤ 0, t ≤ 0, or σ = +∞). Then
//     PlanarSurfaceImpedance.Sheet is exactly Complex.Zero and this arithmetic returns exactly 0.0
//     — the same zero, by the same route the matrix took.
