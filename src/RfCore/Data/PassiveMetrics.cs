// ================================================================
//  PassiveMetrics.cs  —  two-terminal part characterisation from an S-matrix
//
//  brief-passive-readouts-and-touchstone-check.md §2.
//
//  What this file is for. A capacitor, an inductor and a ferrite bead are all sold as an
//  IMPEDANCE versus frequency, and the numbers a designer works in are ESR, C_eff, L_eff, Q and
//  the self-resonance — not S-parameters. A vendor ships the part as a Touchstone file and as a
//  model, and the first thing anyone does is ask whether the two agree. Answering that from S11
//  in dB is possible and nobody does it.
//
//  Why it is not a member of NetworkMetric. Every metric in that enum is a stability or passivity
//  figure computed from one S-matrix and returning one real number, and EvaluateTwoPort loops
//  them over the sweep. These are also per-matrix, but they are functions of an IMPEDANCE that has
//  to be extracted first, and the extraction is a CHOICE the caller makes (see PassiveExtraction)
//  rather than something derivable from the data. Folding a required mode argument into
//  EvaluateTwoPort's switch would make five stability metrics carry a parameter that means nothing
//  to them. Group delay set the precedent for a derived quantity with its own entry point.
