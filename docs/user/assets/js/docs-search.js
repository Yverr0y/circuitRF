/* ============================================================================
   circuitRF — User Documentation search
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   HAND-WRITTEN. The thing this file reads — assets/js/search-index.js — is the
   generated half, rebuilt by tools/DocGen from the Markdown sources.

   It drives every box on the page that carries `data-crf-search`: the small one
   in each page header, and the wide one on the landing page. Both are the same
   markup from the same emitter (HtmlEmitter.SearchBox), so there is one control
   here and not two.

   Three things about the environment shape the whole file:

     * No build step, no dependency, no module loader. The docs are static files
       that must open from a web host, from the loopback server the application
       starts for Help, and from a bare file:// path. Anything that needs
       bundling or fetching is out.
     * The index is a plain global (window.CRF_DOCS_SEARCH) for the same reason:
       a classic <script src> is the only fetch that works on file://.
     * If it is missing, the boxes stay hidden. They are rendered `hidden` and
       unhidden here, so a page whose JavaScript never ran shows no search field
       rather than one that silently eats what you type.

   Ranking, in one sentence: every query word must appear somewhere in a section,
   and a word is worth most in the page's declared keywords, then its title, then
   the heading, least in the body — with a bonus when the whole query appears as a
   phrase, and with WHERE IN A WORD the match landed counting as much as which
   field it landed in.

   That last clause is the part worth explaining, because it is what three real
   reported failures had in common:

     * "CLI" returned sections about CLICKS. A bare indexOf makes every three-letter
       query a substring query, and short strings are inside long words everywhere.
     * "command line" returned the Quick Start's "Headless / command line" heading
       instead of the chapter literally titled "The Command Line" — the exact-title
       bonus was a string EQUALITY that a leading "The" defeated, and a phrase in a
       heading outscored a phrase in a page title.
     * "CL" returned nothing useful, because no title or heading contains it and
       body matching for a two-letter term is noise by definition.

   So a match is classified as WHOLE-word, word-PREFIX or INSIDE-a-word, and a term
   shorter than four characters scores only against names — keywords, title,
   heading — never against prose. A short query is an acronym or something half
   typed; against forty pages of prose it can only ever be noise.
