Your layout is a set of flat shapes. The **stackup** is what turns those shapes into a physical
structure: what each conductor is made of, how thick it is, what dielectric separates it from the
next one, and — the part that catches people — **which conductor is ground**.

That last one is not a detail. An EM port has two terminals, and only one of them is anywhere near
your artwork: the other is the ground plane. **You do not set it per port. The stackup does, for
every port in the run at once.**

## Where the stackup lives {#where}

The stackup is part of a **technology** — a `.ctech` file in the workspace's `tech/` folder, edited
in the technology editor's **Stackup** tab. It belongs to the technology rather than to a layout,
because it describes a *process*: every board built on that process has the same layers, whatever is
drawn on them.

A layout names a technology (or leaves the name blank to mean the workspace default). Everything
else — the layer table, the DRC rules, the default display unit — lives in the same file. See
[The Layout Editor](layout-editor.html#technology) for the rest of it.

**A missing technology does not block drawing, but it does block an EM run.** Layers fall back to a
generated palette and editing carries on; the EM run refuses rather than inventing a stackup, because
there is no honest default for "how far above the ground plane is this trace".

## Anatomy of a stackup {#anatomy}

A stackup is an ordered list, **top to bottom**, of three kinds of entry, plus two boundary
conditions for what is above and below the whole sandwich.

{{ui: stackup-mmic}}

| Entry kind | What it is | What it carries |
|---|---|---|
| **Conductor** | A metal layer | Thickness, conductivity σ, the **drawing layers** that map onto it, and whether it is the **ground reference** |
| **Dielectric** | The material between two conductors | Thickness, ε<sub>r</sub>, tanδ, µ<sub>r</sub> |
| **Via** | A connection *between* two conductors — not a layer of the sandwich | The drawing layer via shapes are drawn on, the two conductors it **spans by name**, and its fill (plated or solid) with a wall thickness |

<div class="callout note">
<span class="label">A field an EM run cannot use is marked as you look at it</span>
<p>A thickness of zero, a permittivity below 1, a conductivity of zero — anything an EM run would
refuse outright — gets a <b>faint amber outline</b> on the box itself, and hovering it says what is
wrong and what would fix it. It is amber and not red on purpose: an unfilled field is a normal state of
a technology somebody is still writing, not a fault.</p>
<p><b>It marks unusable, never merely unlikely.</b> A value that is present and plausible is never
marked, because nothing in circuitRF knows which board you are looking at — so a mark means the run
will stop, and an unmarked field is not a claim that the number is right.</p>
</div>

The two boundary conditions are properties of the stack as a whole:

- **Top** — `Open` (free space above, the usual case) or `Ground`.
- **Bottom** — `Ground` (the usual case) or `Open`.

<div class="callout note">
<span class="label">A dielectric is never drawn, and it is laterally infinite</span>
<p>A conductor entry has drawing layers; a <strong>dielectric entry has none</strong>. It is a sheet
of material spanning the whole problem at its stated thickness, everywhere, because that is what the
solver's Green's function is built on — a stratified medium, uniform in x and y.</p>
<p>This matters most for a <em>thin</em> dielectric that a real process only leaves under and just
beyond a structure — a capacitor dielectric, say. The model carries it as a full sheet at its true
height. That is the standard trade in this class of tool, and it is a good one where the structure
is; it is <em>not</em> free everywhere else, and <a href="#mim">A thin-film (MIM) capacitor</a> gives
the measured cost.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout note">
<span class="label">A drawing layer is not a conductor</span>
<p>What you draw on is a <em>drawing layer</em> — a GDSII layer/datatype pair with a name and a
colour. What gets simulated is a <em>stackup conductor</em>. The link between them is the conductor
entry's <strong>drawing layers</strong> list, and a shape on a layer that is bound to nothing is
simply not part of the EM problem. If a run tells you it found "nothing on a layer bound to a signal
conductor", that binding is what is missing — not the artwork.</p>
</div>

## The Stackup tab, field by field {#tab}

Below is the shipped **four-layer FR-4** technology — the one a new workspace can be created
against — open in the Technology Editor's Stackup tab. Nine entries: four coppers, three dielectrics
between them, and two via entries. It is worth opening yourself alongside this page; everything on it
is described below.

{{ui: tech-editor-stackup}}

### The top row: what is above and below, and how to add an entry

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Top** | The boundary condition above the whole sandwich — `Open` (free space, the usual case) or `Ground`. |
| **Bottom** | The boundary condition below it — `Ground` (the usual case) or `Open`. |
| **＋ Dielectric / ＋ Conductor / ＋ Via** | Appends an entry of that kind. A new entry lands at the bottom of the list; the **↑ ↓** buttons on its own row move it to where it belongs. |

### The summary row: what the stack adds up to, and what it is made of

| Readout | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Stack height** | The sum of every Conductor and Dielectric thickness, in the technology's display unit. **Via entries are excluded** — a via occupies no slice of the stack; it traverses the dielectrics between the conductors it spans. 62.13 mil above is the 62 mil the board is sold as. |
| **conductors / dielectrics / vias** | How many entries of each kind. `conductors: 4` is the layer count a fabricator quotes; `vias: 2` is two *kinds* of connection, not two holes. |
| **board** | Shown only when some other document stated an overall board thickness — a Gerber job file's, today. If it disagrees with the stack height by more than 1%, the row says so and **nothing is corrected**: which of the two numbers is wrong is not something circuitRF can know. |

The filter box below it narrows the list by entry name, and the count beside it is how many of the
nine are showing.

### Every entry: kind, name, order

Each entry is a card. The grey word at its left is its **kind**, fixed when it was added. The box
beside it is its **name**, and the name is not decoration: a via entry names the two conductors it
spans **by name**, and an EM setup names its analysis levels the same way. The three buttons at the
right are **↑** and **↓** — the list is ordered top to bottom and **that order is z** — and **✕**,
which removes the entry.

### A Conductor entry

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Thickness** | The metal's thickness, in the display unit. Used by the cross-section kernel and by interchange; the full-wave planar kernel solves a zero-thickness sheet and uses this only to place it — see [What the EM engine does not read](#ignored). |
| **σ (S/m)** | Conductivity at 20 °C. Sets conductor loss and skin depth in the cross-section kernel. The **combo beside it** is a shortcut that fills the box with a metal's bulk value (copper 5.8e7, silver 6.3e7, gold 4.1e7, aluminium 3.77e7, nickel 1.43e7); the box stays typeable and is what gets saved, and a value matching none of them reads as *Custom*. |
| **Ground reference** | Marks this conductor as the ground plane — **the negative terminal of every port in an EM run**. In the figure it is ticked on `Inner 1` and on `Bottom Copper`; the rule for which one a given run uses is in [the next section](#ground). |
| **Metal thickness goes to** | The full-wave solver has no thickness for metal, so this conductor's thickness is given to the dielectric above it or the one below it. `the layer above` is the default and is what every technology authored before the field existed means. The stack height is the same either way. Full explanation, and the one case that needs the other setting: [Where a conductor's thickness goes](#sheet-surface). |
| **Drawing layer** | Which drawing layers map onto this conductor — a **checkbox list**, because a conductor may carry several, with a filter box above it for a process that has hundreds. A shape on a layer bound to nothing is simply not part of the EM problem. |

### A Dielectric entry

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Thickness** | The separation this material provides. On the figure, 8 mil of prepreg either side of a 42 mil core. |
| **ε<sub>r</sub>** | Relative permittivity. |
| **tanδ** | Loss tangent. |
| **µ<sub>r</sub>** | Relative permeability — 1 for everything that is not a magnetic material. |
| **Patterned with** | `(none)` for an ordinary, laterally continuous dielectric, which is what all three on this board are. Naming a conductor here says *this film exists only where that metal's artwork is* — the thin-film capacitor case, described in [The capacitor dielectric rides along only when its plate is analysed](#mim-tied). |

**A dielectric has no drawing layer, and there is no picker for one.** It is not drawn: it is a sheet
of material spanning the whole problem at its stated thickness.

### A Via entry

Via entries are listed **as their own group below the ordered ones**, under a line saying why: a via
is not a layer of the sandwich and has no position in the top-to-bottom order.

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Spans** | The two conductor entries this via connects, **by name**. The two on the figure differ, and that is the point of a four-layer board: `Plated Through-Hole` runs Top Copper → Bottom Copper, while `Ground Via (L1-L2)` runs Top Copper → Inner 1. |
| **Fill · Plated** | Whether these holes are metal at all. Unticked means a non-plated hole — a mounting hole, a routed cutout — drawn as it is but **not** extracted as a vertical conductor. |
| **Fill kind** | Plated or solid. Carried for thermal work; the RF solve does not read it, because a plated wall a few µm thick is already many skin depths. |
| **Wall** | Plated wall thickness — the metal on the barrel wall, **not** the hole radius. 20–25 µm (about 1 mil) is typical and is what the shipped technologies use. |
| **Drawing layer** | The one drawing layer via shapes are drawn on. **One**, not a list: a via binds at most one, so this is a plain picker with an explicit `(none)`. |

</div>

## Where your port's negative terminal is {#ground}

**Every port in an EM run returns through one plane, and the stackup picks it.** Not the panel, not
the port label, not per port.

The rule, in order:

1. **The ground-designated conductor.** Mark a conductor entry as the **ground reference** in the
   technology editor. The plane is the **top surface of the highest ground-designated conductor that
   lies below the signal level being simulated**.
2. **Failing that, the stack's bottom.** If no conductor is marked and **Bottom = Ground**, the plane
   is taken at the bottom of the stack. The run says so in its notes, and asks you to mark one
   instead — this fallback places the plane by boundary condition rather than by a real conductor's
   surface, which is a different height by the thickness of whatever is down there.
3. **Failing both, the run is refused.** No ground reference and no grounded bottom means no second
   terminal for any port, and there is nothing to solve.

Three consequences worth having in mind:

- **The plane is modelled as laterally infinite.** It is the boundary condition the Green's function
  handles analytically, not a meshed pour — so a ground *pour* drawn as artwork is not it, and a
  finite plane's edges are not modelled. A conductor marked as the ground reference is not meshed and
  cannot also be an analysis level; naming one as a level is refused.
- **An intervening metal layer does not become ground just by being underneath.** The rule keys on
  the *designation*, not on stack position, precisely so that an MMIC's second metal level is not
  mistaken for a plane. Mark what you mean.
- **This is the port's negative terminal for every port type** — an edge port at a conductor end, an
  [internal delta gap](mom-engine.html#ports), or an [internal port](mom-engine.html#ports) whose
  whole purpose is to reach it. It is why an internal port needs a path down to the plane at all.

<div class="callout warn">
<span class="label">If the answer looks wrong by a constant factor, check this first</span>
<p>The height between the signal conductor and the ground plane is the single number a microstrip's
impedance depends on most. A ground reference marked one entry too low — on the far side of a
dielectric you forgot was there — changes every impedance in the run while leaving the result looking
completely plausible. The run's own notes name the conductor it used and its height; read them.</p>
</div>

## Which conductors get simulated {#levels}

A conductor entry that is **not** the ground reference is a *signal* conductor, and a signal
conductor with artwork on it is an **analysis level**.

- With one signal conductor, that is the level. Nothing to choose.
- With more than one, the EM setup can name the levels it wants (the analysis-level list); with none
  named, every signal conductor that actually carries artwork is included.
- Levels are ordered **bottom to top**, and the lowest one sits on the slab's top surface.

## Where a conductor's thickness goes {#sheet-surface}

**The full-wave solver has no thickness for metal at all.** It models a conductor as a
**zero-thickness sheet at one height** — so the slice of the stack that conductor occupies has to be
filled with *something*, and the stackup does not say what fills a metal layer where no metal is
drawn. The answer is that the metal's thickness is given to the dielectric on one side of it, and
which side is a per-conductor setting: **Metal thickness goes to** on the conductor's row in the
Stackup tab.

| Setting | The metal's thickness is added to | The sheet ends up at | Height of a line on it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **the layer above** (default) | the dielectric **above** the conductor | the top surface of the dielectric **below** | the substrate under it, exactly as entered |
| **the substrate below** | the dielectric **below** the conductor | the bottom surface of the dielectric **above** | the substrate **plus this conductor's own thickness** |

**Neither setting moves anything, and the stack height is identical either way** — the total is the
same number in both cases. All that changes is which neighbour absorbs the vanished thickness, and
therefore how high above the ground plane the sheet lands.

**"The layer above" is what you want almost everywhere**, and it is what a conductor that says
nothing means: a trace deposited on a substrate and encapsulated by whatever comes next, whose height
above the ground plane comes out as the substrate thickness. It is also the setting the
**closed-form** microstrip models agree with — they model real metal of real thickness and measure
their height to the metal's *underside*.

**"The substrate below" is for the lower plate of a capacitor.** With the thickness given to the
layer above, that plate's whole metal thickness lands inside the plate gap, and the solver separates
the two sheets by the capacitor dielectric *plus that metal* — 3.2 µm rather than 0.2 on a typical
MMIC metal. Giving it to the substrate below instead puts the gap back to the dielectric alone. The
shipped MMIC technology does exactly this on `Metal1`.

**And it applies only where the capacitor does.** A run that is not analysing the plate has no plate
gap to get right, so a conductor directly under a [patterned dielectric](#mim-tied) is put back to
the default for that run — the same run note that reports the dielectric reports this. That is what
lets one technology set it at all: an ordinary line on `Metal1` still solves against 100 µm of GaAs,
exactly as it did before the capacitor module existed.

<div class="callout note">
<span class="label">This is not "expand up / expand down / symmetric"</span>
<p>Tools whose stackup gives you an <em>interface</em> and a metal thickness have to decide which way
the copper grows from it — up, down, or half each way. <b>circuitRF never asks that</b>, because its
stackup is an explicit ordered list: the conductor is its own row with its own thickness, already
sitting between two named dielectric rows. Its extent is fully determined before any EM question is
asked, and nothing is ever displaced.</p>
<p>This setting answers a <em>later</em> question, and one that exists only for the full-wave planar
kernel: given that the metal already occupies a known slice, and the solver will represent it as a
sheet at a single height, which face is that height and which neighbour fills the gap. <b>There is
deliberately no "symmetric".</b> Half to each side is representable, but no structure wants it: it
would place every ordinary line permanently half a metal thickness away from the closed-form models
circuitRF validates itself against, and for the ground-referenced case that matters the field is in
the substrate under the strip — the underside is the right face there, not a crude default that a
midpoint would refine.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout note">
<span class="label">The cross-section kernel ignores this entirely</span>
<p>It models real metal of real thickness and has no sheet to place, so the setting is read by the
<b>full-wave planar</b> path only. It also never applies to the <b>ground plane</b>, whose boundary
is always taken at its top surface whatever its own row says.</p>
</div>

The trade is stated rather than hidden: in a *capacitor* run a `Metal1` microstrip's EM substrate is
103 µm of GaAs rather than 100 — a ~3% height shift, against a 16× error in the modelled plate
separation. The **closed-form** microstrip models are unaffected either way; they model real metal of
real thickness and measure their height to the metal's underside, so in such a run they and the EM
result differ by up to one metal thickness. The run's notes name each level's z *and* the surface it
sits on, which is where you read back what was actually solved.

## The slab, and what makes one solvable {#slab}

The solver works on the **dielectric between the ground plane and the lowest analysis level**. Two
stackup mistakes are refused by name rather than solved around:

- **The signal conductor sits at or below the ground plane.** There is no slab between them. Almost
  always a stackup written in the wrong order — the list runs top to bottom.
- **There is no dielectric entry between the plane and the conductor.** A conductor floating directly
  on a plane with nothing in between has no substrate to be a microstrip over.

**Several dielectric entries between the two are carried as several layers**, each at its own
thickness, ε<sub>r</sub> and tanδ — the medium is stratified and the solver solves it that way. (It
used to refuse a stratified region under the feed and tell you to merge the entries into one; merging
them changes the physics, and the reason for it is gone.) The run's notes name the layers it found and
print the single ε<sub>r</sub> it uses to *size* the calibration standards and the mesh — the
series-capacitance equivalent of the stack. That number is a mesh-sizing average and never the
reference impedance the answer is published against.

Layers *above* the top conductor are not part of that slab: the top boundary is what is above, and it
is `Open` unless you say otherwise.

## Vias {#vias}

A via entry is not a layer — it is a **connection between two conductor entries, named by name** in
its `Span from` / `Span to` fields. Draw on the drawing layer the entry is bound to, and the EM
extractor turns what you drew into a real vertical current path.

**Two kinds of artwork count**, and both go through the same rules below:

- a **via primitive**, the pad-and-drill point you place with the Via tool;
- a **filled region** — a rectangle or a polygon, holes included. This is what a thin-film
  capacitor's plate connection is: a patch nearly as large as the plate itself, rather than a point.
  Several regions on one via entry are several footprints of the same connection.

A **path** on a via layer is ignored, with a note — a path is a centreline and encloses no area, so
there is no footprint to mesh. Draw the region instead.

Three rules the extractor applies, each reported when it bites:

- **The two conductors must be adjacent in the stack.** A via that skips a level is not built, because
  there is nothing to connect it to in between.
- **A via may terminate on the ground plane**, and that is the common backside/through-hole case: the
  named conductor is the ground-designated one, so the via runs from a signal level down to the plane.
  A via naming some *other* non-analysis conductor is ignored with a note — it would otherwise silently
  model a structure you did not draw.
- **A via primitive's footprint is squared.** A round barrel staircased onto the mesh grid would cost
  a gridline per facet for no physics, so it is replaced by the **equal-area square**, which preserves
  the conducting cross-section. The run reports that it did. **A drawn region is not squared** — the
  substitution exists so a circle nobody drew does not staircase, and an outline you drew already is
  the footprint, so it is meshed as it stands.

<div class="callout note">
<span class="label">An internal port does not need you to draw one</span>
<p>An <a href="mom-engine.html#ports">internal port</a> is placed on the metal and returns to the
ground plane, so it needs a path down there. If you drew a via, it drives yours. If you did not, the
solver builds one — a square of <strong>the technology's default via drill</strong> (or, if the
technology declares none, a quarter of the substrate height), reported by size in the run's notes.
That path is real metal and its inductance is in the answer, which is why you can override it simply
by drawing the via you want.</p>
</div>

## A thin-film (MIM) capacitor {#mim}

A MIM capacitor is a thin dielectric between two metal plates inside the interlayer dielectric. In a
stackup it is **three entries**:

| Entry | Kind | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `MIM Metal` | Conductor | The top plate — a thin metal with its own drawing layer |
| `MIM Dielectric` | Dielectric | The capacitor dielectric: thin, higher ε<sub>r</sub>, **no drawing layer** |
| `MIM Via` | Via | The plate's connection up to the routing metal above it |

The bottom plate is the interconnect metal underneath — no fourth entry. You draw the two plates and
the plate connection; the dielectric is never drawn. **A `Cap Dielectric` or `Nitride` layer in a
layer table is mask documentation, not this.**

Both capacitor forms are ordinary multi-level artwork:

- **Shunt** — bottom plate on the lower metal over one or more backside vias, top plate on the plate
  metal, feed landing on the upper metal through a plate-via region.
- **Series** — feed in on the lower metal, which *is* the bottom plate, and out on the upper metal
  through the plate via.

{{ui: stackup-mim}}

### The capacitor dielectric rides along only when its plate is analysed {#mim-tied}

There is **one** MMIC technology, and it carries the capacitor module. That is only possible because
the capacitor dielectric is **tied to its plate** — the `Patterned with` setting on its row names
`MIM Metal`, and it means *this film exists where that metal's artwork is, and nowhere else*, which
is what a thin film physically is: deposited under the plate and etched away everywhere around it.

**So an EM run carries the film only if the plate is one of its analysis levels.** Draw a capacitor
and the plate has artwork on it, so the film is there and the plates are 0.2 µm apart. Draw plain
interconnect and it is not, so the film enters the medium as **air at the same thickness** — nothing
above it moves — and the lower metal's thickness goes back to the layer above. That run is then
identical, number for number, to the same run on a stackup that never had a capacitor module in it.
**No setting to remember, and nothing to switch.**

**It is always reported.** A run whose tie deactivated says so in its notes, naming the dielectric,
the plate that would switch it back on, and the thickness setting it reverted. A medium you did not
author and cannot see is exactly the kind of change that produces a complete, believable answer to a
question nobody asked.

Why it has to work this way: a stackup dielectric is [laterally infinite](#anatomy), so a film that
was simply *present* would be present in every run. That is not free, and both costs are large enough
to see:

- **Airbridge posts would stop solving.** A post between the two metals would cross a dielectric
  interface, and a via that crosses one is refused by name — the closed-form integral along a via is
  written in one region's coefficients. **That refuses the whole run**, it does not drop a shape.
- **A line on the lower metal would move.** The 0.2 µm ε<sub>r</sub> 6.8 sheet would sit on it as
  superstrate: measured on the acceptance line, ε<sub>eff</sub> rises ~1.7% and Z₀ falls ~2.8%.

Both are correct physics *for a run that has a capacitor in it*, and wrong for one that does not. The
tie is what tells the two apart. (circuitRF shipped two MMIC technologies for exactly this reason
until the tie existed; if you have a workspace holding its own copy of the older pair, they still
work — nothing in a workspace is rewritten by a new release.)

**What is still bounded:** with the plate level in the analysis, a post between the two interconnect
metals skips a level, and a via must span two conductors that are adjacent *in the analysis*. It is
dropped with a note. Capacitor plates and airbridge posts in one EM setup remain separate runs — but
they are now separate runs on one technology, not two.

### Adding a capacitor module to an imported technology {#mim-import}

A technology imported from a process description often arrives **without** its capacitor module. A
process stack description states the interconnect — the metals, the insulation between them, the vias
that join them — and treats an optional thin-film module as exactly that: optional, and frequently
left out, while the layer table shipped beside it still lists the module's drawing layers. The import
is faithful to what it was handed, so what you get is a valid technology whose plate layers draw
perfectly and connect to nothing.

**The import report says so, by name.** Two of its notes are about this and only this:

- *"No via in the file names these conductors…"* — a conductor the stack describes that no via entry
  reaches. It cannot be connected, and the file never said how it should be.
- *"The layer table defines N drawing layer(s) no stackup entry is bound to…"* — layers you can draw
  on that the stack does not model. A shape on one is artwork, not structure. A real layer table has
  plenty of these legitimately, so the note counts them and names the first dozen.

Neither is an error, and neither is a guess: nothing in the file states the missing piece, so
circuitRF names the gap rather than inventing an entry to fill it.

**The fix is three rows** in the Technology Editor's Stackup tab, in stack order, and it takes about
two minutes. Numbers below are silicon-nitride-class examples — take yours from the process:

| Row | Kind | What to set |
|---|---|---|
| The capacitor dielectric | Dielectric | Thickness *d* (50–300 nm; 0.2 µm here) and ε<sub>r</sub>. **No drawing layer.** |
| The top plate | Conductor | Its thickness (0.25 µm here) and its **drawing layer** — the plate layer the import already brought in |
| The plate connection | Via | **Span from** the plate **to** the metal above it, and its own **drawing layer** — the plate-via layer the import already brought in |

Insert them between the two interconnect metals, in that order, top plate above dielectric. The bottom
plate is the interconnect metal underneath — there is no fourth row, and nothing is drawn for the
dielectric.

**ε<sub>r</sub> comes from the capacitance density the process quotes**, which is the number a process
actually publishes:

<p class="center">ε<sub>r</sub> = C″·<em>d</em> / ε₀</p>

At C″ = 0.30 fF/µm² over *d* = 0.2 µm that is 6.8 — the value the shipped MMIC technology carries. Work
it out from your own two numbers rather than copying a permittivity out of a materials table: the
capacitance is what you want the model to reproduce, and *d* and ε<sub>r</sub> only ever appear
together in it.

**Then two settings on the rows around it**, and neither is optional:

- **Tie the dielectric to the plate** — `Patterned with` on the dielectric's own row, set to the top
  plate you just added. Without it the film is a continuous layer of the medium, present in every run
  on this technology, and the two costs in [the tie's own section](#mim-tied) land on your
  interconnect: airbridge posts between those metals refuse the whole run, and a line on either metal
  moves in ε<sub>eff</sub> and Z₀.
- **Give the lower metal's thickness to the substrate below** — see
  [Where a conductor's thickness goes](#sheet-surface). A conductor is solved as a
  zero-thickness sheet, and by default its thickness is given to the layer *above* it, so the
  modelled plate separation would be your dielectric **plus the lower plate's whole metal
  thickness** — several times the gap you just entered, with a plausible capacitance to show for it.
  The tie reverts this setting for you in any run that is not analysing the plate, which is why it is
  safe to set at all.

**Add the rows to the technology your designs already use** — there is no copy to make and no
retargeting to do. With the tie set, a run that draws no plate artwork extracts exactly as it did
before you added the rows: the film enters the medium as air at the same thickness and the sheet
surface goes back, and the run's notes say so.

**What activation does change**, stated so it is not a surprise the first time a capacitor run
disagrees with an interconnect one: in a run that *does* analyse the plate, the film is real, and the
lower metal's line sees it. Its thickness is given to the substrate instead, so that substrate grows by that
metal's own thickness, and ε<sub>eff</sub>/Z₀ move with it. That is the capacitor run's real physics,
not an artifact — it is the same structure a capacitor sits in.

Two things to know before you read a number off the result: within a run the dielectric is
[laterally infinite](#anatomy) — present everywhere at its stated thickness, which is a good
approximation because the fields that set the capacitance are confined under the plates — and the
mesh has to resolve the gap, which is the subject of the next section.

### Reading a capacitance off a MIM run {#mim-accuracy}

<div class="callout warn">
<span class="label">Never read a small element off a RAW solve, and mesh the gap</span>
<p>The solver models the plate separation the process states — 0.2 µm on the shipped MMIC technology,
the capacitor dielectric and nothing else. (It used to model 3.2 µm: a conductor is solved as a
zero-thickness sheet, and with that thickness given to the layer above it the lower plate's whole
metal thickness fell inside the gap. The lower plate's entry now gives its thickness to the
<strong>substrate below</strong> instead — see <a href="#sheet-surface">Where a conductor's
thickness goes</a>.) The run's notes print every level's z <em>and</em> the surface it sits on, so you can
always read back the separation it used.</p>
<p><strong>A port on upper metal now de-embeds.</strong> It used to be refused: the reference
impedance a de-embedded answer is published against is Z<sub>c</sub> = γ/(jωC<sub>pul</sub>), and
C<sub>pul</sub> came from an electrostatic image series over one grounded slab — the right problem for
a trace on the substrate's own top surface and the wrong one for metal buried in the interlayer
dielectric. The solver now solves that electrostatics at the port level's own height in the real
stack, so an ordinary two-port MIM network de-embeds like anything else. The same change lets a
technology carry several dielectrics <em>under</em> the lowest analysis level, which used to be
refused with "merge the layers".</p>
<p><strong>Read the capacitance from the de-embedded answer, never from a raw one.</strong> A raw
solve's s-parameters include each port's own discontinuity, and that discontinuity is a
fraction-of-a-femtofarad series element: read a small capacitance through it and you read the port,
not the capacitor, whatever the plates do. That is not special to a capacitor — a matched 50 Ω GaAs
microstrip reads |S<sub>21</sub>| = 0.07 raw at 10 GHz. (An earlier revision of this page said the
plate capacitance was "not modelled", on a measurement taken through exactly that raw path —
retracted.)</p>
<p><strong>And mesh the gap.</strong> The one thing that genuinely limits a plate capacitance is the
mesh: the cross-level part of the fill degrades as the cell size grows against the plate separation,
and the extracted capacitance follows it — within 10% of ε₀ε<sub>r</sub>A/d while the ratio is at
most 5, 1.46× at 12.5, and the wrong sign at 25. <strong>The shipped MMIC technology's default mesh
sits outside that</strong> (a 10 µm plate pair 0.2 µm apart meshes at 2.5 µm, i.e. 12.5), and the run
says so in its notes — it is a note rather than a refusal because the rest of the structure is
unaffected. Refine the mesh over the plates until the note stops firing before you trust the
value.</p>
</div>

**The shunt form's backside via sets an upper frequency.** A vertical basis carries uniform current
along its whole run, so a via is refused above k·ℓ = 0.3. Through 100 µm of GaAs that ceiling is just
under 40 GHz; the refusal says so and names the number it computed. The series form has no such via
and no such bound.

## What the EM engine does not read {#ignored}

Stated plainly, because a field that is carried but unused is worse than one that is absent:

- **Conductor σ is not used by the full-wave planar kernel.** It models metal as a perfect conductor;
  conductor loss is not in the answer. The **cross-section (uniform-line) kernel** does use it, for
  its Wheeler-incremental-inductance surface resistance.
- **Conductor thickness is not modelled by the full-wave kernel either** — it solves a zero-thickness
  sheet. The thickness itself is used by the cross-section kernel and by interchange, and the
  full-wave kernel gives it to one of the two dielectrics beside the conductor. Which one is
  normally invisible (3 µm of metal under a 100 µm substrate moves nothing), and matters exactly
  once: between the two plates of a [thin-film capacitor](#mim). It is a per-conductor setting —
  see [Where a conductor's thickness goes](#sheet-surface).
- **A via's fill and wall thickness are carried for thermal work**, not read by the RF solve: a plated
  wall a few µm thick is many skin depths at RF, so plated and solid behave the same.

## Checking what it resolved to {#check}

**Every EM run says which conductor it used as ground, and at what height**, in its notes — along with
the level list, the slab it built, and any via it ignored or built for you. That report is the
authoritative answer to "where is my port's negative terminal", and it is written by the code that
actually did it rather than re-derived for display.

If you are chasing a result that looks plausible but wrong, read those notes before anything else:
almost every stackup mistake produces a complete, believable answer for a structure you did not draw.
