# Sonnet Brief — RC-7: the commit action, the history browser, and variants

**Read `brief-revision-control-0-overview.md` first.** The architecture is
`docs/design/revision-control.md` §5.2, §5.5, §6.1, §6.3, §6.4 and §4.2. **Depends on RC-5 and RC-6.**

**Scope: the narrative half** — the sparse, deliberate, human-written history a designer creates on
purpose and browses later. This is the risky, user-facing stage, which is why everything else came
first.

---

## 1. What this is, and what it is not

**R-rc7-1. Ordinary commits on the ordinary branch, created deliberately, with a title the designer
wrote.** This is what the history browser shows, what is shared, and what is pushed (RC-9).

**R-rc7-2. Hidden entirely when git is absent** (§4.3), visible-and-refusing when held (RC-6
R-rc6-8). The pair is deliberate and the brief must ship both halves.

**R-rc7-3. The designer is never shown a commit graph, a branch name, a detached HEAD, or a merge
conflict. They are shown their own design at an earlier moment.** Git is what makes that cheap and
durable; it is not what the feature is about.

**R-rc7-4. The one qualification, and it is not a loophole.** "No git vocabulary" governs what is shown
to a designer who never asked for version control. It does not govern what is shown to someone who has
just pressed **Commit** — that person has opted in, and withholding the identifier of the thing they
just created would be coyness, not clarity. The rule is: **nothing git-shaped appears unbidden; what an
explicit action produces may be named precisely.**

---

## 2. What a commit says

**R-rc7-5. A commit message records how the commit came about**, because six weeks later *"which of
these did I mean?"* is the only question anyone asks of a history. Three origins, three distinguishable
messages:

| origin | message shape |
|---|---|
| the user pressed **Commit** and typed a title | the user's title, plus a line recording that this was an explicit commit by the user |
| the workspace was **closed** | a message stating the workspace was closed — the designer did not choose this moment, and the history must not imply they did |
| **before an AI batch** | the batch's own intent — *"before: widen the output match"* — on the checkpoint reference, never on the designer's branch |

**R-rc7-6. The distinction between the first two is the point.** A designer scanning their history has
to be able to tell *"I decided this was worth keeping"* from *"circuitRF kept this because I shut the
lid"*, **without opening either.** The automatic one is not lesser — it is frequently the one that
saves them — but it means something different, and a history that renders them identically is lying by
omission.

**R-rc7-7. The Messages panel reports an explicit commit, and names it.** One entry: what was
committed, and **the commit's identity**. That identifier is what makes the escape hatch usable — it is
what the designer, or someone helping them, types into a git command when circuitRF's own UI cannot
answer the question. R-rc7-4 is why naming it here does not contradict the vocabulary rule.

**R-rc7-8. Automatic checkpoints still post nothing** (RC-5 R-rc5-11). They are in the restore-point
list, which is where someone looking for one looks.

---

## 3. The browser

**R-rc7-9. The browser shows the narrative; the restore-point list shows the safety net; they are not
merged.** Conflating them produces a log no human will read, which then makes the safety net useless
too because nobody looks at it. They may sit side by side and must not interleave.

**R-rc7-10. An "off" period renders as a gap, with its reason** (RC-6 R-rc6-13). Rendering it as an
ordinary interval between two commits is the false-belief failure in its purest form.

**R-rc7-11. A commit can be compared, and comparison is the browser's real job.** What changed between
two states, at the granularity of documents rather than lines — this is the design layer's question,
not the text layer's. Where a per-document diff is genuinely useful (a `.csch`'s connectivity, a
`.ctech`'s layer table) that is a legitimate follow-up and **not this brief's scope**; naming a
changed document is.

---

## 4. Conflicts: whole-file, pick a side

**R-rc7-12. There is no merge for a layout, and circuitRF must not pretend there is.** A three-way text
merge of a polygon's vertex list can produce geometry that is invalid, or valid and wrong, while
remaining perfectly well-formed JSON that opens without complaint. The same is true of a schematic's
connectivity. **A merged design that is silently wrong is worse than a conflict**, because the conflict
is at least visible.

RC-3's generated `.gitattributes` already marks the five document types unmergeable, so git will not
attempt one. This brief builds what the user sees.

**R-rc7-13. Conflict resolution is presented as a choice between two NAMED versions, never as a diff to
reconcile.** Who wrote each one and when, and what changed in each — enough to choose, and no
invitation to merge by hand.

**R-rc7-14. This is not conservatism, and the observation belongs in the code comment.** Large
analog/RF design-management architectures are centralised and **pessimistic** — check-out/check-in
locking so two people cannot edit one cellview concurrently, versioning at the granularity of the
cellview rather than the file, and a separate configuration object binding which version of which cell
a hierarchy resolves to. **The locking is the direct consequence of no-merge**: when merge is
impossible, preventing divergence is the only remaining strategy. circuitRF builds no lock server, but
that is why whole-file resolution is correct rather than lazy, why RC-2's read-only default is the
cheapest available approximation of a lock, and why RC-9's pins are the one genuinely enterprise-grade
item on the list.

---

## 5. Variants — the one place a branch exists

**R-rc7-15. Designers will not create branches and are not asked to.** The native idiom for trying an
idea in this domain is already **another cell, or another view within a cell** — cheaper, visible in
the project tree, and comparable side by side, which a branch is not.

**R-rc7-16. Branches appear, unavoidably, in exactly one scenario: restore an old state, then keep
editing.** Git requires a branch there. The branch is created **silently and named after the design
intent**, and surfaced as a *variant* — *"You are editing from an earlier version; saving will create a
new variant."* **The words branch, checkout and HEAD appear nowhere.**

**R-rc7-16a. The restore this builds on is RC-5's and already has preconditions** (§5.8, R-rc5-12a/b):
it takes a checkpoint of the state it replaces, offers up unsaved work through the existing prompt, and
**discards the undo stacks of reloaded documents**. This brief does not re-implement any of that and
must not weaken it — in particular, a variant created by editing after a restore does not make the
pre-restore checkpoint redundant, because that checkpoint is what a designer who chose the wrong
restore point gets back from.

**R-rc7-17. Two variants must be distinguishable in the browser and in the project tree**, because the
whole failure mode is a designer editing in one and looking at the other. §10B.2 scenario 3 exists
because this surprises people.

**R-rc7-18. Stashes are excluded** (§6.4). A stash solves a problem designers do not have — a dirty
tree blocking a branch switch, in a world where they do not switch branches. Their equivalent is
already "save a copy of the cell", and it is better because it is visible.

---

## 6. The translation layer, now in front of a user

**R-rc7-19. RC-3's recognised-failure table is what this brief renders**, and this is the first stage
where a failure lands in front of a designer who initiated the action. Every failure reaching the UI is
one of RC-3's translated sentences or is reported verbatim and honestly (RC-3 R-rc3-5) — never
swallowed, never replaced with a generic apology.

**R-rc7-20. Any failure this brief encounters that RC-3's table does not name is added to that table**,
not handled locally. A translation living only in the UI is a translation `src/Cli` does not have.

**R-rc7-21. The one place §8.3's escape hatch is stated in plain language is here** (RC-0 §5). History
rewriting is the only real remedy for a large file already committed, circuitRF must not offer a button
for it (R-rc0-7), and a user who genuinely needs it should be **told so plainly rather than left to
conclude the application has no answer**. It sits beside the commit action because that is where
someone looking for it will be. One sentence: this is something `git` can do, circuitRF will not do it
for you, and it invalidates every existing clone — which is why.

---

## 7. Gates

1. **Three origins, three distinguishable messages** (R-rc7-5): assert a user commit and a
   workspace-close commit are told apart **from the history listing alone**, without opening either
   (R-rc7-6).
2. **The commit identity is reported once, on an explicit commit only** (R-rc7-7, R-rc7-8).
3. **No git vocabulary except where R-rc7-4 permits it**: source-scan every user-visible string for
   branch, checkout, HEAD, detached, stash, merge — comments stripped. The one permitted appearance is
   the identity in R-rc7-7's entry, and it is asserted by name so the exemption cannot spread.
4. **Hidden without git, visible-and-refusing when held** (R-rc7-2) — both halves.
5. **Checkpoints do not appear in the narrative browser**, and commits do not appear in the restore-point
   list (R-rc7-9).
6. **An off period renders as a gap with its reason** (R-rc7-10), driven by the data RC-6 records.
7. **A conflict offers two named versions and no reconcile path** (R-rc7-13): assert there is no code
   path that writes a merged file for any of the five unmergeable types.
8. **Restore-then-edit produces a variant** (R-rc7-16), named after the intent, with no vocabulary
   leaking; and two variants are distinguishable (R-rc7-17).
9. **Every failure surfaced to the user came from RC-3's table** (R-rc7-19): a local sentence for a git
   failure fails the gate.
10. **A restore reached from the history browser still checkpoints first** (R-rc7-16a): assert the
   pre-restore state is restorable after a restore-then-edit that produced a variant.
11. **The §8.3 sentence exists and offers no button** (R-rc7-21): source-scan for a rewrite,
   amend, rebase or filter code path and fail on a hit, comments stripped.
12. **Headless parity where it exists.** Anything `src/Cli` can also do produces the same result as the
    GUI path, byte for byte, exempting only a legitimately-varying timestamp and naming it.

## 8. Documentation (§10B.2 scenarios 2, 3, 4)

- **Scenario 2** — *"I want to keep this version — it's the one I'm sending out."* An explicit commit,
  its title, and where it shows up afterwards.
- **Scenario 3** — *"I went back to an old version, then kept working."* What happened, why there are
  now two lines of work, and how to tell them apart. **Notably without the words branch or checkout.**
- **Scenario 4** — *"Two of us are editing the same workspace."* Whole-file, pick a side, and **why
  circuitRF will not merge them** — which is a statement about geometry and connectivity, not about
  effort.

---

## 9. On completion

Findings to `src/Ui/RESOLVED.md` and `src/Design/RESOLVED.md` — **never to a `CLAUDE.md`**.

**Report, do not silently absorb:**
- Every git failure encountered that RC-3's table did not name (R-rc7-20), and whether it was added
  there rather than handled locally.
- Whether the variant naming produced anything a designer could not read, which is the single most
  likely place vocabulary leaks.
- Whether the browser could show what changed at document granularity without a per-document diff, and
  what it cost if not (R-rc7-11).
- Whether the variant path interacted badly with RC-5's pre-restore checkpoint (R-rc7-16a) — two
  restore points a designer cannot tell apart would be a finding, and the fix is wording, not
  mechanism.
