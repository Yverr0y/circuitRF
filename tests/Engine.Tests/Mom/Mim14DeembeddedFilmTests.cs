// brief-em-mim-14-refloor-the-full-wave-limit.md — THE DE-EMBEDDED LADDER, RE-RUN ON THE REPAIRED
// KERNEL, AND THE FIXTURE THAT CAN CARRY IT.
//
// MIM-12 measured the de-embedded two-port of a thin-film plate pair and found it correct to
// cell/separation 40, sign-INVERTED by 80 and noise at 200; PlanarLevels.FullWaveCellOverSeparation
// was set to 40 on the strength of it. MIM-12a then repaired the kernel underneath — the thin
// region's own image series is peeled out of the DCIM fit and carried in closed form — and did NOT
// re-run the ladder, because the replacement fixture it built read 6-10x low at cell/separation 2,
// where no film is involved at all. So the floor stood on a measurement of a kernel that no longer
// existed, and it was refusing a spiral-plus-capacitor at 66.7.
//
// WHAT THE FIXTURE HAD TO GET RIGHT, AND WHY IT IS MOST OF THIS FILE:
//
//  1. BOTH PORTS ON THE LOWEST LEVEL. A de-embedded edge port above the lowest analysis level is
//     MIM-4's, and MIM-4 shipped — but the topology a user actually draws routes the top plate up
//     and back down to a landing pad beside the bottom one, so both terminals abut the same metal.
//     That is what this fixture does, and it needs nothing MIM-4 added.
//
//  2. THE ELECTROSTATIC CONTROL GOES THROUGH THE RUN'S OWN FIT. Dcim.ForStackAtFrequency, which
//     PlanarFrequencyKernel.Fit calls. A PlanarKernelSet built without it is a different instrument:
//     on this very fixture it reads C/(eps0 epsR A/d) = 0.033 at 1 GHz where the run's own fit reads
//     1.006. MIM-12 step 0's whole finding, one brief on.
//
//  3. THE CAPACITANCE IS Im(-Y21)/w, NEVER -1/(w*Im(-1/Y21)). Both are "the series element read from
//     -1/Y21"; only the first is the quantity an electrostatic C12 is. -Y21 is the pi model's direct
//     branch ADMITTANCE, G + jwC; inverting first and reading the reactance gives C(1 + 1/Q^2) — 12%
//     high at the Q ~ 3 a thin-metal fixture has. T4 pins it.
//
//  4. THE FIXTURE'S OWN SERIES INDUCTANCE IS SEPARATED IN CLOSED FORM, BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE
//     SHORTENED. The calibration refuses feeds closer together than five substrate heights, so a
//     de-embedded two-port of a lumped element on a 103 um substrate necessarily carries ~600 um of
//     line and ~437 pH with it. The branch is L in series with C, so 1/Im(-Y21) = 1/(wC) - wL is
//     EXACTLY linear in w; two-parameter least squares over the three frequencies returns C free of
//     the instrument and returns L, which is a property of the pinned artwork and must come back the
//     same at every rung. Reading one frequency instead measures the fixture: at cell/separation 200
//     with a 4.35 pF plate the 3 GHz point sits on the fixture's own self-resonance and reads 3.9x.
//
// THE RESULT: no rung from cell/separation 0.5 to 200 departs from the electrostatic mutual
// capacitance of the same mesh by more than 10%, and every point is passive. The floor is 200. Both
// ladders and all three controls are tabulated in HISTORY.md §MIM-14; what is here is one test per
// claim, not one per rung.
