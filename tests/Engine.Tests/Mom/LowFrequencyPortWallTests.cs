// LFP — the de-embedding error floor stops under-predicting, and the band edge it names follows the
// law of the term that binds.
//
// `docs/sonnet-briefs/brief-em-lf2-port-discontinuity-as-a-lumped-element.md` §"What must SHIP".
// PEEL derived `DeembedErrorFloor` on a UNIFORM LINE, where the DUT's own discretisation error is
// the same shape as the standards' and cancels, so the standards' `ConsistencyResidual` was the
// whole of it. On the shipped MMIC spiral it does not cancel, and the published floor read 1.106e-2
// at 320 MHz against a realised error of about 0.5 — 40× low, on a row that is 9× wrong, and
// therefore a per-point guard that stayed silent on exactly the rows it exists for.
//
// EVERY NUMBER BELOW IS MEASURED AND NONE OF IT IS SOLVED HERE. The floor is a pure function of
// three scalars already on `PlanarErrorBox`, so the DECISIONS — which term binds, what the floor
// then reads, which threshold it crosses, which band edge the remedy sentence can offer — are
// arithmetic and belong in the routine tier at zero cost. The spiral's own literals come from
// `src/Engine/Mom/RESOLVED.md` §LFP §4; `LowFrequencyPortWallPhysicsTests` is what re-solves them.
