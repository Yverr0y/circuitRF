// CL3 — the metal is a real conductor by default, and these are the gates that say what that is
// worth. `docs/sonnet-briefs/brief-conductor-loss-3-default-and-gate.md`; findings in
// `src/Engine/Mom/RESOLVED.md` §CL3.
//
// CL1 built the surface-impedance term and left it behind a null `PlanarFillSettings.ConductorLoss`;
// CL2 read it back out as `P_conductor`. Neither changed a number anyone runs. This brief flips the
// default in `PlanarSolve.Run` — the one scope where σ and t are in reach — and what has to be
// proved is not that the term exists (CL1 did that) but that it reaches the SHIPPED path and lands
// where CL1's convergence result says it should.
//
// Four things are gated here:
//
//   R-cl3-0  Milestone 0's decision. The quasi-static calibration path's γ takes its conductor term
//            from the standard's OWN static charge, and the reason is that it tracks the fill's own
//            α_c on the same mesh where kernel A's Wheeler term over-reads it by 20-75 %.
//   R-cl3-3  The phase gate: a de-embedded 50 Ω line's α out of kernel B against kernel A's, at
//            2 / 10 / 20 GHz on both starters, ground held PEC in BOTH.
//   R-cl3-4  Passivity and reciprocity get STRICTER, not looser. Adding loss cannot make a passive
//            structure active, and a re-bless would bury it if it did.
//   R-cl3-6  Every number above names the calibration path that produced it, and α is read from the
//            de-embedded S₂₁ rather than from the calibration's own γ.
