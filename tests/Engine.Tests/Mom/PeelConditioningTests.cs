// PEEL — "a 3.8 mm microstrip de-embedded at 10 MHz publishes |S11| = -1.37 dB where the line gives
// -60.2 dB, and nothing in the run says so."
//
// The defect that reached a user is not the 59 dB. It is that the 59 dB arrived with NO SENTENCE
// ATTACHED — and that the one diagnostic anybody would have checked, `DeembedResidual`, is
// ANTI-CORRELATED with the truth down there: it is smallest exactly where the answer is worst,
// because two standards whose x = e^{-γℓ} are both approaching 1 agree better and better with each
// other while determining the error box less and less.
//
// WHAT THE MEASUREMENT FOUND, AND IT IS NOT WHAT THE BRIEF PREDICTED. The brief attributed the
// amplification to the factor (x₂² − x₁²) ≈ 2γΔℓ that both halves of the a₂₂² quotient carry, i.e.
// to the two standards' SEPARATION. That was measured directly and it is inert: a 30× longer second
// standard — βΔℓ from 0.40° to 11.8° at 10 MHz — moves the de-embedded |S₁₁| of a uniform line by
// under 6 %, and at 100 MHz a 30× separation is TEN TIMES WORSE. The amplifier is the one RAW1 §6
// and LF1 §5(a) already named: `Apply` forms Y = (S_meas − a₁₁)/a₂₁², an edge port at the bottom of
// a band is a series gap capacitance, so a₂₁ ∝ ω and the division is by an ω².
//
// Four things are gated here:
//
//   P1  THE LAW. |ΔS| on a uniform line = ConsistencyResidual · |a₁₁| / |a₂₁|², to a ratio near 1
//       over three stacks, three mesh densities and three decades. This is the primary gate and the
//       oracle is the control itself — a de-embedded S₁₁ on a plain line must be exactly 0, so no
//       second model is in the path.
//   P2  Δℓ IS INERT. The recorded number the "do not re-lengthen the standards" rule rests on.
//   P3  THE CUBE. `DeembedErrorFloor` is published per (frequency, port) beside the two residuals.
//   P4  THE GUARD. A run whose floor is catastrophic is REFUSED with a sentence naming the band edge
//       that answers it; one whose floor merely exceeds the budget is NAMED; and neither changes a
//       single published number on a run that is nowhere near either threshold.
