/// referenced workspace's sub-tree can open declare that property. The template's comment used to say
/// every other type "binds null here and renders unmarked" — and that is not what happens. A property
/// the runtime object does not have is not null, it is <c>UnsetValue</c>, and a property left unset
/// takes its DEFAULT. <c>IsVisible</c>'s default is <c>true</c>.</para>

/// <para><b><c>IsForeign</c>, two lines above it, is not the precedent it appears to be</b>: it runs
