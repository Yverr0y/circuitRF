// ================================================================
//  MarkerFrequencyToleranceTests.cs
//
//  An adjacent defect found while building the logarithmic X axis (brief-dd-log-frequency-axis
//  §"While you are here"), fixed and gated on its own: resolving a marker to its data point used an
//  ABSOLUTE tolerance of 1e-6 Hz — a relative 5e-13 at 2 MHz and roughly two ULPs at 2 GHz.
//
//  Measured: a marker asked for 2138469.2 Hz against a stored 2138469.1999823763 Hz — the same
//  number to ten significant figures, and the number the run's own `.s2p` wrote — missed its point
//  and SILENTLY snapped to the next one, 4.573 MHz, landing on top of another marker.
//
//  In-app placement was never at risk: AddMarkerAtFreqIndex copies Data.Frequencies[fi] verbatim.
//  What this bites is a frequency that has been ROUND-TRIPPED, TYPED or UNIT-CONVERTED — which is
//  exactly what a marker editor and a re-imported Touchstone do.
