// ================================================================
//  CoupledInductorsExampleTests.cs — the shipped CoupledInductors example reports a REAL k
//
//  Owner, 2026-09-15: the example's `k_implied = mag(SP1.S(2,1))` is not a coupling factor. It never
//  was — on this circuit it runs 0.013 at 100 MHz to 0.436 at 5 GHz while k is 0.5 everywhere, so it
//  is a transmission magnitude wearing a k's name, and an example that names a quantity wrongly
//  teaches the wrong thing to everyone who opens it.
//
//  The replacement is the extraction itself: S -> Z on the two-port, which for two grounded windings
//  gives Z11 = jwL1, Z22 = jwL2, Z21 = jwM directly, and then k = M/sqrt(L1*L2). Both Z0 and w cancel
//  in that ratio, which is why the answer is flat and exact rather than a curve that happens to pass
//  through 0.5 somewhere.
//
//  Gated end to end — the example is RUN, not just parsed — because the claim is about the numbers.
//  ~1 s: 99 linear points on a four-component circuit.
