//
//  THE RECIPE, END TO END: EM everything except the 0.2 µm capacitor gap, and put the closed-form
//  capacitance in the circuit beside the result. It is what a MMIC designer does anyway — a MIM
//  capacitor on a known process is ε₀εᵣA/d to a fraction of a per cent, and what earns the EM run is
//  the coil, the crossover and the ground return, none of which is anywhere near the film.
//
//  It is also the remedy the engine itself now names. A user who draws this whole resonator and
//  presses Simulate is REFUSED (MIM-9's LevelSeparationVerdict), and the refusal's second remedy is
//  the sentence this file measures: take the upper level out of the EM run and model the part it
//  carries as a circuit element beside the EM result.
//
//  TWO CLAIMS, TWO TESTS:
//
//   1. The coil alone is a clean passive two-port, and composed with the kit's own 1.0838 pF it is a
//      series resonance. Tagged Benchmark — it is a de-embedded full-wave sweep, which is what the
//      opt-in tier is for. The composition goes through a real `.cnl`, an SnP component and
//      SParameterEngine, NOT through arithmetic here: MIM-10's own gate says the composed response
//      is the gate and a single extracted L is not, because this coil does not HAVE one constant L
//      (5.91 / 3.56 / 3.13 nH at 1 / 2 / 3 GHz — a distributed structure with a Metal2 underpass).
//
//   2. The `.s2p` says which drawn label became which port number. Fast, and gated on the function
//      rather than on a sweep, exactly as NonPassiveCaveatTests gates the caveat sentence.
