//  CL7 — the ground plane reaches a user.
//  `docs/sonnet-briefs/brief-conductor-loss-7-ground-reaches-a-user.md`;
//  findings in `src/Engine/Mom/RESOLVED.md` §CL7.
//
//  CL4 built a conducting ground plane on the general kernel and CL6 built it on the one-slab
//  kernel. Every gate in both passed and §CL4 §9 had to record that NO RUN A USER COULD MAKE GOT
//  ONE, because `PlanarExtractor` wrote `Termination.Pec` into both media. This file is the
//  assertion that it no longer does.
//
//  Its whole subject is the EXTRACTOR — `tests/Engine.Tests/Mom/GroundReachesAUserTests.cs` gates
//  what the termination is worth, on both starters and against kernel A. What is asked here is the
//  question those cannot ask: does the σ a user typed into the Stackup tab arrive?
