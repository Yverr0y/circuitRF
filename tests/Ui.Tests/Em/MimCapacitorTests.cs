// MIM-2/MIM-7 — the GaAs starter technology states a thin-film (MIM) capacitor, and both capacitor
// forms extract as ordinary multi-level planar EM problems.
//
// What this file is FOR. Until MIM-2 no shipped technology could express a MIM capacitor at all, so
// every capability the rest of the series builds had no in-tree structure to run on. The shipped
// MMIC technology now can — the plain MMIC starter plus a plate conductor (MIM Metal), the thin
// dielectric under it (MIM Dielectric) and the plate's connection up to the routing metal (MIM Via)
// — and these fixtures are the shapes a user would draw on it. They are built in CODE on the real
// shipped technology rather than committed as artwork, for the reason RegionViaExtractionTests
// states: a fixture that restates the technology is a second copy of it that drifts.
//
// IT WAS A SECOND TECHNOLOGY FROM MIM-2 TO MIM-7, and the reason it no longer is, is the point of
// the gate below. Stating a capacitor dielectric between Metal1 and Metal2 made every airbridge
// post refuse to solve (a WHOLE-RUN refusal from the kernel, not a dropped shape) and moved a
// Metal1 microstrip's Z0 by 2.8% — neither acceptable silently on the technology every existing
// MMIC workspace copied. Both costs came from the film being present in runs that contain no
// capacitor. StackupLayer.PresentWithLayer ties the film to its plate, so it enters the medium only
// when the plate is one of the run's ANALYSIS LEVELS, and an interconnect-only run extracts
// BIT-IDENTICALLY to the same run on a stack with no module at all — which is what
// AnAirbridgePost_SolvesOnTheOneTechnology_AndExtractsIdenticallyToTheModuleFreeStack asserts.
//
// NOTHING IN THE EXTRACTOR IS PER-CAPACITOR, and the two-capacitor fixture is here to hold that
// shut: every shape on a selected level is taken and every region on a via entry is taken, so a
// matching section made of several capacitors and the lines between them — which is what an MMIC
// actually contains — needs no new machinery. If that ever stops being true, this is where it shows.

// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// FINDING 1 — CLOSED at MIM-6 (2026-08-30): the plate separation is the dielectric alone
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// MIM-2 measured this file's three levels at z = 100 / 103.2 / 106 um: `PlanarExtractor` placed a
// level's zero-thickness sheet at the BOTTOM of its conductor band and absorbed the band into the
// dielectric ABOVE, so Metal1's own 3 um of metal landed INSIDE the plate gap and a 0.2 um process
// separation solved as 3.2 um — 16x. It was not fixable by authoring: TechValidation requires a
// positive thickness on every band, and Metal1's sheet was pinned by the microstrip case.
//
// MIM-6 gave a conductor entry a reference SURFACE (`StackupLayer.SheetAt`), with the absorption
// direction paired to it so every sheet still lands on an interface of the medium by construction.
// The shipped MIM technology sets Metal1 = Top; the levels above are now 103 / 103.2 / 106 and the
// region between the plates is 0.2 um of er 6.8. Bottom (and unset) is the old behaviour, bit
// identical — SheetReferenceSurfaceTests holds that, and holds the mechanism generally.
//
// THE STATED COST, asserted rather than commented: the region under Metal1 is 103 um of GaAs
// instead of 100 (~3%), and on this technology the closed-form microstrip path still says 100 —
// see AMetal1Microstrip_...'s own note for why SubstrateResolver is deliberately not taught the
// field. Full record: src/Design/RESOLVED.md and src/Ui/RESOLVED.md.
//
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// FINDING 2 — RETRACTED (2026-08-30): the constant 0.30 fF was the PORT DISCONTINUITY
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// This block originally concluded that the cross-level plate-to-plate term was "missing or
// negligible in the full-wave planar kernel". Wrong — the defect was in the measurement, not the
// kernel. The gap-ladder table (one-port shunt capacitor, C read off Im(Y11), 0.30 fF to within 1%
// across a 32x change in the modelled separation) was read off a RAW, un-de-embedded solve, and a
// raw edge port's own discontinuity is a ~0.3 fF SERIES element standing in front of everything
// behind it: series(0.3 fF, C_plate) is ~0.3 fF for every C_plate well above 0.3 fF — including the
// table's slight upward trend toward that limit as the plate capacitance grows. The original "NOT
// the feeds" argument discriminated nothing: a port discontinuity's capacitance is every bit as
// frequency-independent as the plate's.
//
// The controls that pinned it (scratch-harness solves, 2026-08-30):
//   * Engine-direct, a one-level 400 um line at 10 GHz: de-embedded |S21| = 0.9858 while the SAME
//     solve's raw |S21| = 0.0000. Raw S measures the ports, not the structure — the solver's own
//     ceiling refusal says raw is "for diagnostics only".
//   * The L9 phase-gate record (src/Engine/Mom/HISTORY.md §L9): a via-bridged two-level structure
//     transmits de-embedded |S21| = 0.9993 against 0.0502 with the posts removed, at N = 1,023 —
//     vias conduct and cross-level coupling is present through the calibrated path.
//   * Region vias behave identically to the L9-validated point-via path on the same shunt fixture
//     (0.199 vs 0.204 fF — both the port discontinuity), so MIM-1 is not implicated either.
//
// What remains true: a raw solve cannot read a femtofarad-scale element behind its own port
// discontinuity — of ANY structure, not of MIM capacitors specifically. Hence the solve test above
// gates the with-via/without-via COMPARISON, which the discontinuity (common to both runs) cannot
// fake, and still carries no magnitude band. Finding 1 was brief MIM-6 (level reference surface)
// and is CLOSED, 2026-08-30 — which is what makes MIM-3's ladder measurable: a 0.2 um plate gap is
// now what the solver actually sees, so its physics tier measures the real regime rather than a
// 3.2 um one. Thin-separation ACCURACY is still MIM-3's, and this brief claims none of it.
// Full narrative: src/Ui/RESOLVED.md §MIM-2 and §MIM-6.
