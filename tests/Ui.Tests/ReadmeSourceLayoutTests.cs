// ================================================================
//  ReadmeSourceLayoutTests.cs — every `src/…` path README.md names actually exists
//  (brief-automation-5-protocol-adapter.md §7's gate).
//
//  README.md describes the source tree in THREE places — the annotated project list under
//  `## Architecture`, the firewall's own list, and the `## Source layout` tree — and they drift
//  together. Nothing catches it: a folder that moved leaves three sentences behind, each still
//  perfectly readable and each now wrong.
//
//  A path that no longer exists is the CHEAPEST possible signal that the annotation beside it is
//  also stale. This test cannot check an annotation's prose, and does not pretend to; what it does
//  is fail the moment a described folder is not there, which is when someone reads the sentence
//  next to it. That is the whole claim.
