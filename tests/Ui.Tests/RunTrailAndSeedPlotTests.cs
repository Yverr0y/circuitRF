// ================================================================
//  RunTrailAndSeedPlotTests.cs
//
//  Two things a user report exposed that are not the same bug, and are both about a trail or a
//  brace saying something the code does not do.
//
//   1. A run wrote its netlist and then went silent: no plan line, no engine line, and the same
//      design ran normally a minute and a half later. That gap is Prepare returning a non-Success
//      plan — a branch that reported only to the Messages panel, which a crash report does not
//      carry. Every early exit between "netlist written" and "left the engine" now leaves a note,
//      because the trail is what gets read when there is no stack, and a run that ends with no
//      note reads as a run that vanished.
//
//   2. The trail showed two "addPlot … (now 2)" notes six seconds apart — the same count before
//      both, and no removePlot between them, which reads as an add that silently failed. An
//      untraced Ctrl+Z explains it exactly and nothing could say so, because undo and redo rewrite
//      the state every other breadcrumb describes and left none of their own.
//
//  Plus the brace that went with it: DataDisplayViewModel's constructor deselect sat at the
//  indentation of the addEmptyPlot branch WITHOUT braces, so it ran either way.
