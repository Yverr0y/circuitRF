# Example workspaces

These are **real circuitRF workspaces**, not templates and not an archive to unpack. Open any of
them here, in this folder, and edit it — that is the point of them being files.

They also ship with the application. `src/Ui/CircuitRF.Ui.csproj` copies this whole tree into the
build output, and **Tools ▸ Examples** in the running application copies one to a folder the user
picks and opens it there. The user's copy is theirs; nothing writes back into this one.

## Adding an example

1. Make the workspace in here, as a folder with a `.cws` in it.
2. Add a row to `examples.json` — the folder name, the title the menu shows, and one sentence.
   The order of that file is the order of the menu. A folder that is not in the index is offered
   by nothing; an index row whose folder is missing is skipped rather than shown as a menu item
   that fails when pressed.
3. Write a `README.md` beside the `.cws` saying what the example teaches. **It is what the user
   sees first**: a workspace whose open restores no documents of its own opens on its README,
   read-only, instead of the Welcome tab. Headings, bold, italics, bullets, fenced code blocks
   and two-column tables all render; anything else degrades to plain text (`src/Ui/Markdown/`).

`tests/Ui.Tests/Examples/ExampleWorkspacesTests.cs` holds the rest shut: the index and the disk
agree both ways, every schematic still extracts with its device in it, nothing names anybody's home
directory, and the tree reaches the build output.

## What is deliberately not here

**Results.** An example ships its design and its EM setup; the user runs them. The antenna's own
sweep is 52 MB, and a committed result is a claim about an engine version that will stop being
true. `examples/*/results/` is git-ignored at the repo root and excluded from the packaged build.

**Anything a user could not have drawn.** These are teaching documents, so every one of them is
authored out of the ordinary component library and the ordinary analyses.
